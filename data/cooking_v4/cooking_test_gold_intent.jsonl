Any kind of shortening or cooking oil will work great for deep frying jalapenos. <|EOS|> Make your batter and breading. <|step|> To make your batter, mix 0.5 cups (120 mL) of flour, 0.5 cups (120 mL) of milk, and one egg in a bowl. In a separate shallow bowl or plate, put 3 tablespoons (44 mL), 1.5 cups (350 mL) of breadcrumbs, and 1.5 teaspoons (7.4 mL) of salt and mix them thoroughly. This is your breading. If you want to add other spices to your batter put them in the dry mixture on the plate. Some great spices to use would be garlic, paprika, or chili powder. If you want to add a liquid ingredient like beer or lime juice, add it the mixture in the bowl with the raw egg. <|EOS|> Slice your jalapeno peppers to fit your recipe. <|step|> If you are frying jalapenos without any filling, cut them into small rings by slicing across the width of the jalapeno pepper. If you plan on adding in a stuffing to the pepper, make an incision on one side of the pepper where so you can remove the seeds and inject the filling. If you plan on putting some kind of filling in the jalapeno pepper, like for stuffed jalapeno poppers, you should put in your stuffing mixture before you begin battering the peppers.

Make sure that the entire pepper is coated in the batter. <|EOS|> Coat the battered jalapeno peppers in the breading. <|step|> Roll the peppers on the plate until they are fully coated the breading. To avoid a mess, you might want to bread the jalapeno peppers one at a time. If your breading is getting clumpy or too moist from the batter, add a few pinches of flour and mix until the clumps break down. You can also add a bit of salt to soak up some moisture. <|EOS|> Place the jalapenos in the hot oil. <|step|> Be careful and gentle placing the jalapenos into the hot oil to avoid splash-back. You should use tongs or forks to drop the peppers in to decrease the chance of being burnt by the hot oil. Avoid letting the jalapeno peppers touch each other while they fry.

The salt can be used according to taste, but if you aren't sure how much to use, try a total of 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of salt for one full squash. For a sweeter taste, add brown sugar, as well. Sprinkle up to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of brown sugar over the slices, patting it down into place so that it sticks to the squash. <|EOS|> Cook for 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven. <|step|> The delicata squash should be tender enough for you to easily glide a knife through. The top should also be browned. If you used brown sugar, the top should be caramelized. Roasting at a lower temperature will make the squash even more tender.

Cornstarch is a good way to thicken the frosting without increasing its sweetness. Mix 1 tablespoon (25 grams) of cornstarch into the frosting. If it is still too runny, add a little more. Continue to add cornstarch until you are happy with the texture. Avoid adding more than 1/2 cup (62.5 grams) of cornstarch per 8 oz (226 grams) of cream cheese. Adding more cornstarch than this can impact the taste of the frosting. In some countries, cornstarch is called corn flour. <|EOS|> Refrigerate the frosting for 1 hour to thicken it without adding extra ingredients. <|step|> Cream cheese will vary in thickness depending on the temperature. Transfer the frosting into an airtight container to stop it from soaking up other smells, and then place it into the fridge. The cool air will harden the fats in the cream cheese and butter, and make the icing thicker. If the cream cheese is still too soft after 1 hour, leave it in the fridge for a further 30 minutes. If the cream cheese frosting gets too hard, simply leave it at room temperature to soften. <|EOS|> Add a small amount of meringue powder to quickly thicken the frosting. <|step|> Add 1 tablespoon (7 grams) of meringue powder to the frosting per 8 oz (226 grams) of cream cheese.

This option is really effective if you want to pipe the frosting onto a cake as it helps the mixture to hold its shape. <|EOS|> Mix 1 tbsp (14.2 g) of soft butter into the frosting to make it creamier. <|step|> The fats in the butter will help to thicken the cream cheese frosting and will add a rich and creamy taste. Mix the frosting with a spoon until the butter is completely dispersed in the mixture. Continue to add soft butter to the frosting until you are satisfied with its taste and consistency. If your butter is hard, simply leave it at room temperature for 1 hour to soften. <|EOS|> Add 2 tsp (5.2 g) of arrowroot powder if you want a flavourless thickener. <|step|> Arrowroot is similar to cornstarch but it has very little flavour, which makes it perfect for adding to frosting.

Look inside the lobster tank for lobsters that seem healthy and active. Avoid lobsters that are too still or have holes or black marks on their shells. <|EOS|> Fill a large pot ¾ full with water. <|step|> Add 2 tablespoons of coarse salt for each quart of water, and bring the water to a quick boil. <|EOS|> Plunge the lobsters into the water. <|step|> One at a time, pick up the lobsters by the body and plunge them headfirst into the boiling water. Cover the pot with a lid. Do not allow the water to overflow. If there isn’t room in the pot for all the lobsters you bought, cook them in two or more batches. <|EOS|> Cook the lobsters. <|step|> Once the water has come to a boil again, begin timing the cooking of the lobsters. One-pound lobsters should cook for about 15 minutes, 1 ½-pound lobsters for 20 minutes, and 2-pound lobsters for 25 minutes. The lobsters are finished cooking when their shells have turned bright red. Remove them from the pot and set them on a plate on their backs to dry and cool. This keeps the juices in the lobsters. It’s important to time the cooking, since lobsters may turn red before they are fully done. <|EOS|> Serve the lobsters whole. <|step|> Place each lobster on a dinner plate for serving. Serve each lobster with a small cup of melted butter, a nutcracker for cracking the claws, a lobster pick and a bowl for the discarded shells.

As such, this works well if you intend to eat the beans on their own or want to add them to a hearty dish, like chili. It may not work so well if you intend to use them in a sweeter or milder dish. <|EOS|> Bring the pot of beans to a boil. <|step|> Cover the stockpot and bring the water up to a boil over high heat. <|EOS|> Let simmer until tender. <|step|> As soon as the water reaches a boil, reduce the heat to medium and let the beans continue to simmer until they become tender enough to pierce with a fork. If you soaked the adzuki beans beforehand, this should only take about 60 minutes. If you did not soak the beans or soaked them for less than an hour, you might need to wait closer to 90 minutes. Tilt the lid slightly as the beans simmer so that steam can escape, thereby avoiding a build-up of pressure. Periodically skim off excess foam that rises to the top of the water as the beans cook. If necessary, add more water if too much of it seems to escape during the cooking process. <|EOS|> Add desired seasonings. <|step|> The beans can be served or added to recipes as they are, but if you want something a little more flavorful, you can add salt, black pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, or your other favorite bean seasonings after turning off the heat and draining the beans. You should drain the beans before adding your seasonings to ensure that the seasonings stick to the beans and do not get lost or diluted in the water. <|EOS|> Serve. <|step|> Drain the beans, if you have not done so in the seasoning step, and serve the beans while still hot. You can serve adzuki beans in tortilla shells, in a bowl with a side of cornbread, or with cooked rice. The beans can also be added to casseroles, bakes, chili, and stew. Alternatively, you can cool the beans and add them to fresh salads. You can store cooked adzuki beans in airtight containers for five days in the refrigerator or six months in the freezer.", "Response": "You can store them for 5 days in an airtight container in the fridge or 6 months in the freezer.", "Current_step_idx": 2, "Next_step_idx": 6, "intents": "req_confirmation"}

If it’s still too loose, add another 1 tbsp (15 g) and try again. Try to add just enough cracker crumbs to bind the mixture together. If you add too much, the crab cakes may end up with a dry texture. You will probably use about 0.33 cup (80 g) of cracker crumbs total. <|EOS|> Refrigerate the bowl of crab cake mixture for 30 minutes (optional). <|step|> Letting the mixture chill for half an hour helps meld the flavors and makes it easier to form it into patties. However, you’ll still get good results if you don’t have the time for this step. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap before putting it in the refrigerator. Otherwise, the mixture may pick up unwanted smells from inside the fridge. <|EOS|> Shape the crab cake mixture into round patties. <|step|> Scoop up a small handful of the mixture and use your two hands to cup and pat it into a disc shape similar to a hockey puck. To get 4-6 patties from this recipe, aim to make each patty roughly 4 in (10 cm) in diameter and 1 in (2.5 cm) thick. To end up with 8-12 appetizer-sized patties instead, make them about 2 in (5.1 cm) in diameter and about 0.75 in (1.9 cm) thick. <|EOS|> Dredge the crab cakes in flour. <|step|> Gently drop each patty into a shallow bowl containing about 0.5 c (120 g) of flour. Flip the patty over in the bowl so both sides get a nice coating of flour on them. Alternatively, you can lay the patties out on a tray, sprinkle flour over one side of each patty, then flip them all over and dust the other sides with flour. <|EOS|> Preheat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. <|step|> Add 0.5  c (120 ml) of peanut, canola, or vegetable oil to the skillet and allow it to heat on the stovetop for 3-5 minutes. <|EOS|> Place the crab cakes into the skillet, without crowding them. <|step|> Each crab cake should have at least 1 in (2.5 cm) of free space on all sides. If you can’t fit all the crab cakes into your pan at one time and give them all this amount of space, you’ll have to cook them in 2 or more batches. If you have to cook them in batches, add a little more oil to the pan before starting each subsequent batch. <|EOS|> Cook the cakes for about 5 minutes, then flip them carefully. <|step|> After 3-4 minutes of cooking, use a spatula or spoon to peek at the underside of each cake.

For extra flavor, add 1 tablespoon (7.5 g) of grated Parmesan cheese over each egg. <|EOS|> Bake the eggs for 7 to 12 minutes. <|step|> The longer you bake the eggs, the more firm they will become. Soft-center eggs are great if you want to eat them for breakfast on a plate.

These eggs are essentially what you'd get if you cracked an egg open on a frying pan. <|EOS|> Grease a muffin tin with a light coat of cooking spray. <|step|> How many wells on the muffin tin you grease depends on how many eggs you want to make. If you want to make 12 eggs, then grease 12 wells. If you want to make 3 eggs, then grease only 3 wells. You can use ramekins too. Place these on a baking sheet to make them easier to take in and out of the oven. A butter-flavored cooking spray would work especially well here because it will give the eggs a pan-fried flavor. <|EOS|> Crack 1 egg into each muffin tin or ramekin. <|step|> Again, how many eggs you crack open depends on how many you want to make. Most muffin tins can hold 6 to 12 eggs, depending on the number of wells that they have. Do not break, stir, or scramble the yolks. <|EOS|> Pour 1 to 2 teaspoons of heavy cream over each egg. <|step|> If you don't have heavy cream, or don't want to use it, try melted butter instead. This is very important because it will help keep the egg whites from drying out in the oven. <|EOS|> Season the eggs with salt, pepper, and grated cheese, if desired. <|step|> A dash of salt and pepper is all you really need. For extra flavor, add 1 tablespoon (7.5 g) of grated Parmesan cheese over each egg. <|EOS|> Bake the eggs for 7 to 12 minutes. <|step|> The longer you bake the eggs, the more firm they will become. Soft-center eggs are great if you want to eat them for breakfast on a plate. If you wish to use the eggs in a breakfast sandwich, however, a firm-center egg would work better because it won't be as runny. Listed below are the recommended baking times:\nSoft: 7 to 8 minutes\nMedium: 9 to 10 minutes\nFirm: 11 to 12 minutes <|EOS|> Serve the eggs as soon as you take them out of the oven. <|step|> The eggs will continue to cook from the inside, so they will become more firm as time goes by. If you made soft-center eggs, then enjoy them as soon as you can. Add more flavor to the eggs by seasoning them with dried herbs or extra shredded cheese.", "Response": "Alright, then bake them 7-8 minutes.

While not strictly necessary, it's a good idea to sift the flour into the bowl to remove any lumps and make it less dense. If necessary, you could use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, but the resulting wrappers might be slightly less durable. <|EOS|> Beat in the egg and water. <|step|> Add the beaten egg and cold water to the center of the flour well. Gradually beat these ingredients into the flour until well-combined. The resulting dough should be very smooth. Start by adding only 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of cold water, then gradually add more water as needed to achieve the desired texture. Use cold water only; warm water may make the dough too sticky to work with. <|EOS|> Knead the dough. <|step|> Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface. Knead it for several minutes, or until it becomes notably more elastic. If there's enough room in the bowl, you could knead the dough in the bowl during this step. You should handle the dough with well-floured hands either way. <|EOS|> Chill overnight. <|step|> Return the dough to the bowl.

Avoid sprinkling too much flour directly over the dough since adding too much excess flour may result in denser, less crispy wrappers. If the dough seems too sticky as you work with it, try refrigerating it for a longer period of time. <|EOS|> Cut the dough into squares. <|step|> Use a smooth knife to cut the dough into 12 squares, each measuring 4 inches (10 cm) on all sides. You'll need to make four columns across the top and three rows along the side to produce 12 evenly sized squares. <|EOS|> Flatten each square. <|step|> Using a floured rolling pin, flatten each square until it measures roughly 6 inches (15 cm) on all sides. <|EOS|> Use as needed. <|step|> Stack the wrappers, layering plastic wrap or parchment paper in between each one.

You need to give it at least 4 hours, but 8 to 12 hours will be best. <|EOS|> Roll out the dough. <|step|> Turn the chilled dough out onto a well-floured surface. Roll the batch into a rectangle measuring roughly 12 inches (30.5 cm) wide and 16 inches (40.6 cm) long. You also need to apply generous amounts of flour to the rolling pin used for this step. Avoid sprinkling too much flour directly over the dough since adding too much excess flour may result in denser, less crispy wrappers. If the dough seems too sticky as you work with it, try refrigerating it for a longer period of time. <|EOS|> Cut the dough into squares. <|step|> Use a smooth knife to cut the dough into 12 squares, each measuring 4 inches (10 cm) on all sides. You'll need to make four columns across the top and three rows along the side to produce 12 evenly sized squares. <|EOS|> Flatten each square. <|step|> Using a floured rolling pin, flatten each square until it measures roughly 6 inches (15 cm) on all sides. <|EOS|> Use as needed. <|step|> Stack the wrappers, layering plastic wrap or parchment paper in between each one. Tightly wrap the entire stack with additional plastic wrap and refrigerate the wrappers until you're ready to use them. These wrappers will dry out if stored for prolonged periods, so you should try to use them within several days.", "Response": "I will send you the recipe for dark chocolate truffles.

Add 4 cups (1 liter) of water and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Turn the heat to medium-low and put the lid on the pot. Let the rice simmer for 45 minutes. It should be completely soft and the water should be absorbed. You can also make the red rice in a rice cooker. Follow the manufacturer's instructions. <|EOS|> Prepare a slow cooker and the fruit. <|step|> Get out a 3.5 to 4-quart (or 3.5 to 4 liter) slow cooker and spray it with cooking spray. This will prevent the red rice pudding from sticking. Set the slow cooker aside. Measure out 1 cup (160 g) of dried fruit and roughly chop or snip them with cooking shears to make small pieces.

Add 3 tablespoons (50 g) of fine ground salt and use a spoon to mix the cabbage. If you prefer to calculate the ratios of cabbage and salt needed instead of going off a measurement, weigh your cabbage and add about 2% of the cabbage's weight in salt. You'll need about 2 large heads of cabbage to get 4 ⁄2 pounds (2.0 kg) of shredded cabbage. If you don't have fine ground salt, use kosher or pickling salt as long as they don't have additives such as iodine or anti-caking agents. These would make the brine cloudy and make fermentation difficult. <|EOS|> Massage the cabbage and let it rest for 10 minutes. <|step|> Use your fingers to rub the cabbage as though you're massaging it. Keep doing this until the cabbage begins to feel wet. Then set it aside for 10 minutes. You can clean your storage jar while the cabbage is resting. Wash it with hot, soapy water or run it through the dishwasher to ensure it's clean. <|EOS|> Pound the cabbage for 5 to 10 minutes. <|step|> Take a pounder such as the end of a rolling pin, a tamper, or a pestle and push down firmly on the cabbage. Keep doing this until the cabbage starts dripping salty water when you scoop it up. You'll need this brine to ferment the cabbage. If you prefer, transfer the salted cabbage to a mixing bowl and beat the cabbage with a dough hook attachment for 2 to 3 minutes. <|EOS|> Mix in the caraway seeds and pack the cabbage into your clean jar. <|step|> If you'd like to add caraway seeds to your sauerkraut, stir 2 tablespoons (15 g) of caraway seeds at this point. Spoon all of the cabbage into a clean 68-ounce (2 liter) jar and pour the brine into it. You may have to use the pounder to push all of the cabbage into the jar. There should be at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of headspace at the top of the jar. <|EOS|> Cover the top of the cabbage with a leaf or lid and weigh it down. <|step|> The shredded cabbage must remain submerged in the brine so you'll need to keep it pushed down. Lay a whole cabbage leaf or a canning lid that fits in the jar on top of the shredded cabbage. Then place a sterilized rock or weight on the leaf or lid. To sterilize a rock, boil it for 10 minutes and let it cool. To add additional flavor, you could weigh the cabbage down using a half of an onion. <|EOS|> Seal the jar. <|step|> Purchase a small airlock system that screws onto the top of your jar. You can find these at home brewing and fermentation supply stores. The system will probably have a valve that lets carbon dioxide escape from the jar without letting oxygen in the jar. If you're using a small fermentation crock, check to see if it already has a built-in airlock system. <|EOS|> Store the jar of sauerkraut at room temperature for 2 weeks. <|step|> Place the sealed jar of sauerkraut in a cool pantry that's away from direct sunlight. The temperature in the room should be between 54 °F (12 °C) and 70 °F (21 °C). Leave the sauerkraut to ferment for 2 weeks. If the room is too cool, the cabbage won't ferment and if it's too hot, the cabbage will spoil. <|EOS|> Store the jar in the fridge once you’ve achieved the desired flavor. <|step|> Remove the lid and weight from the top of the sauerkraut. Dip a fork into the jar and taste a little of it. If you like the flavor, you can start eating it and storing it in the refrigerator.

What's next? <|EOS|> [system] What kind of salt are you using, before we move on? <|EOS|> [user] I have some basic kosher salt since I like how big the crystals are. Is that a problem? <|EOS|> [system] Kosher salt should be fine, as long as you know it doesn't have anything like iodine or anti-caking agents in it. I don't know if you're aware, but these can actually inhibit the fermentation process so you won't get good sauerkraut at the end of this! <|EOS|> [user] I see, that's a really interesting chemistry fact! My kosher salt doesn't have anything added to it so I can go ahead and use it right? <|EOS|> [system] Right, so now you're going to massage the cabbage and let it rest for 10 minutes. <|EOS|> [user] So I just rub it with my hands for 10 minutes? Is there a specific consistency that I need to get it to? <|EOS|> [system] So the cabbage needs to feel a bit wet as the salt draws the moisture out of the cabbage. Does it feel wet to you yet? <|EOS|> [user] Yeah it feels kinda wet and soggy. Is that ok?", "File": "131-243-217_selfchat.json", "Index": 399, "Knowledge": "Toss the shredded cabbage with salt. <|step|> Put 4 ⁄2 pounds (2.0 kg) of shredded green cabbage into a large bowl. Add 3 tablespoons (50 g) of fine ground salt and use a spoon to mix the cabbage. If you prefer to calculate the ratios of cabbage and salt needed instead of going off a measurement, weigh your cabbage and add about 2% of the cabbage's weight in salt. You'll need about 2 large heads of cabbage to get 4 ⁄2 pounds (2.0 kg) of shredded cabbage. If you don't have fine ground salt, use kosher or pickling salt as long as they don't have additives such as iodine or anti-caking agents. These would make the brine cloudy and make fermentation difficult. <|EOS|> Massage the cabbage and let it rest for 10 minutes. <|step|> Use your fingers to rub the cabbage as though you're massaging it. Keep doing this until the cabbage begins to feel wet. Then set it aside for 10 minutes. You can clean your storage jar while the cabbage is resting. Wash it with hot, soapy water or run it through the dishwasher to ensure it's clean. <|EOS|> Pound the cabbage for 5 to 10 minutes. <|step|> Take a pounder such as the end of a rolling pin, a tamper, or a pestle and push down firmly on the cabbage. Keep doing this until the cabbage starts dripping salty water when you scoop it up. You'll need this brine to ferment the cabbage. If you prefer, transfer the salted cabbage to a mixing bowl and beat the cabbage with a dough hook attachment for 2 to 3 minutes. <|EOS|> Mix in the caraway seeds and pack the cabbage into your clean jar. <|step|> If you'd like to add caraway seeds to your sauerkraut, stir 2 tablespoons (15 g) of caraway seeds at this point. Spoon all of the cabbage into a clean 68-ounce (2 liter) jar and pour the brine into it. You may have to use the pounder to push all of the cabbage into the jar. There should be at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of headspace at the top of the jar. <|EOS|> Cover the top of the cabbage with a leaf or lid and weigh it down. <|step|> The shredded cabbage must remain submerged in the brine so you'll need to keep it pushed down. Lay a whole cabbage leaf or a canning lid that fits in the jar on top of the shredded cabbage. Then place a sterilized rock or weight on the leaf or lid. To sterilize a rock, boil it for 10 minutes and let it cool. To add additional flavor, you could weigh the cabbage down using a half of an onion. <|EOS|> Seal the jar. <|step|> Purchase a small airlock system that screws onto the top of your jar. You can find these at home brewing and fermentation supply stores. The system will probably have a valve that lets carbon dioxide escape from the jar without letting oxygen in the jar. If you're using a small fermentation crock, check to see if it already has a built-in airlock system. <|EOS|> Store the jar of sauerkraut at room temperature for 2 weeks. <|step|> Place the sealed jar of sauerkraut in a cool pantry that's away from direct sunlight. The temperature in the room should be between 54 °F (12 °C) and 70 °F (21 °C). Leave the sauerkraut to ferment for 2 weeks. If the room is too cool, the cabbage won't ferment and if it's too hot, the cabbage will spoil. <|EOS|> Store the jar in the fridge once you’ve achieved the desired flavor. <|step|> Remove the lid and weight from the top of the sauerkraut. Dip a fork into the jar and taste a little of it. If you like the flavor, you can start eating it and storing it in the refrigerator. If you want it to have a stronger fermented flavor, seal it back up and ferment it for another week. Then check it again. Refrigerating the sauerkraut will stop the fermentation process.

{"Context": "[system] Hello. Do you need help? <|EOS|> [user] Oh boy, do I! I want to make a chocolate bar, please", "File": "200-497-415_selfchat.json", "Index": 488, "Knowledge": "Melt 1/4 cup (50g) of coconut oil in a small saucepan. <|step|> Measure the coconut oil into a small saucepan and transfer it to the stove. Put the saucepan over a medium heat and let the coconut oil melt, stirring occasionally. While almost any coconut flavor will be disguised by the chocolate, you might be able to detect a few hints of it in the finished chocolate. If you don’t have coconut oil or don’t like the taste of it, you can use the same amount of cocoa butter instead. <|EOS|> Sift 1/4 cup (30g) of cocoa powder into the coconut oil. <|step|> Measure out the cocoa powder and carefully sift it into the melted coconut oil, removing any lumps as you go. Use a wooden spoon to stir the two ingredients together until fully combined. Use the highest quality, unsweetened cocoa powder you can find when making your own chocolate. This will be the majority of the flavor in your bars, so poor-quality cocoa powder will result in poor-quality chocolate. Although it won’t be quite as good as chocolate made with cacao nibs, cocoa powder is considerably easier to find. Both methods will still create delicious homemade chocolate. <|EOS|> Stir the sweeteners and vanilla extract into the chocolate mixture. <|step|> Add 1 ⁄2 tablespoons (22 ml) each of honey and maple syrup to the saucepan, before mixing in 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of vanilla extract. Stir the mixture thoroughly until all the ingredients are fully combined and the chocolate is homogenous. Run your measuring spoon or cup under hot water before using it to scoop up the honey or maple syrup. The residual heat will prevent them from sticking to the spoon and will make it much easier to get into the saucepan. The vanilla extract won’t add a strong vanilla flavor to your chocolate, it will only bring out the chocolatey-ness of the cocoa powder. If you have a particularly strong aversion to it, you can leave it out of the recipe. <|EOS|> Pour the chocolate into molds. <|step|> Remove the chocolate mixture from the heat and carefully pour into your selected molds. For a traditional chocolate bar shape, use a lined, square baking tray that you can cut chocolate bars out of later.

{"Context": "[system] Hello! Are you ready to make some Greek Yoghurt? <|EOS|> [user] Ready to go! How do I start off?", "File": "196-476-390_selfchat.json", "Index": 546, "Knowledge": "Prepare the milk. <|step|> Pour 1 liter (¼ gallon) of milk into a clean saucepan and let it heat until it's just nearly scalding. When it reaches a temperature of about 176° F (80° C), remove it from the burner. <|EOS|> Let the milk cool down. <|step|> You can use an ice-bath if you like, or simply let it cool on its own. When the milk cools down to a temperature of 108° to 115° F (42° to 46° C), transfer it into a glass or earthenware bowl. Do not use stainless steel. Allow to cool down until it's just warm. Why shouldn't you use stainless steel as a receptacle for the milk? Yogurt is made using bacteria cultures, which need very specific environments to survive and breed in. Using metal (stainless steel) can interfere with the bacteria culture. <|EOS|> Add the yogurt or culture packets. <|step|> First check that the milk has cooled to the right temperature. Feel the side of the bowl with your hands. If it has cooled down enough, whisk in 3 tablespoons of live yogurt or one yogurt starter package until completely incorporated. If you incorporate plain yogurt into your milk, make sure the yogurt you use contains a live culture. Check the label on the yogurt packet to make sure that \"live culture\" is written on there somewhere. (Some commercial yogurt products don't contain a live culture.) If using a yogurt starter packet (which contains the necessary bacteria culture), follow the manufacturer's directions about which proportions to use. <|EOS|> Keep the yogurt warm for approximately 4 to 12 hours. <|step|> Cover your not-yet-yogurt with a clean towel, turn on the oven to its warm setting, and let rest for at least 4 hours but preferably overnight. If you can, try to set the oven's temperature so that it stays at a steady 108° F for the entire time. Why does the bacteria need heat to make yogurt out of milk? 108° F is approximately the temperature at which the yogurt cultures begin consuming the lactose in the milk. This process is called fermentation, and it's the same process that produces beer from wheat or wine from grapes. <|EOS|> Strain the yogurt. <|step|> The next morning, the yogurt should look like a white firm custard.

When it reaches a temperature of about 176° F (80° C), remove it from the burner. <|EOS|> Let the milk cool down. <|step|> You can use an ice-bath if you like, or simply let it cool on its own. When the milk cools down to a temperature of 108° to 115° F (42° to 46° C), transfer it into a glass or earthenware bowl. Do not use stainless steel. Allow to cool down until it's just warm.

Using metal (stainless steel) can interfere with the bacteria culture. <|EOS|> Add the yogurt or culture packets. <|step|> First check that the milk has cooled to the right temperature. Feel the side of the bowl with your hands. If it has cooled down enough, whisk in 3 tablespoons of live yogurt or one yogurt starter package until completely incorporated.

{"Context": "[system] Ok, great.  The right temperature is important so hope you are at least near 275 deg F.  Can you see the wood chips smoking?  Most chips work well but Apple wood chips are excellent when smoking poultry. <|EOS|> [user] Oh no, I didn't know about the Apple Wood chips, I just used one that was around the smoker already.  Next time I will try the apple wood chips but the wood chips that I am using are definitely smoking. <|EOS|> [system] Now that things are smoking hot, it's time to get those turkey's on the smoker.  Use your tongs to put the turkey legs on the grill and close the lid. Please don't burn yourself... be careful of the hot grill. You always have to wash your tongs very well once they touch the raw meat.  You know what they say about all types of poisoining - be careful. I will tell you next steps once you close the lid. <|EOS|> [user] How's it going?  I'm ready to move on to the next step, it's very simple.  Please confirm that you have put the turkey legs on the grill and I will tell you what's next.  I hope you didn't burn your fingers by accident. <|EOS|> [system] Ok since you are ready to move on, listen careful, this part is really important.  Please smoke the turkey legs for at least 3 hours and up to 6 hours - it's according to your preference , anything in that timeframe is good.  Most importantly is that the internal temperature of 165 deg F must be reached.  It's best to use a thermometer -  a meat one by the way, not the one you use on babies, lol.  Ok, jokes aside.  Please go ahead and I will check how things are going at about the 3 hr 30 min mark.  Talk to you again soon.  Let those babies bake to a nice golden brown. <|EOS|> [user] It's been 3 hours and 15 min.  Things are looking good but I think I will leave the legs on for another 1 hr.  Is that ok? <|EOS|> [system] Yes, another hour is probably good.  You can always add more time if you need to in an hour.  Ok, once you are finished in the next hour or so.  Remove the turkey and let them rest for  20 minutes..... This wait time (ok, I know it's smelling fabulous but you have to wait), the reason for the wait to keep the juices inside and that is going to make it tender and juicey, not a dried out piece of turkey leg.  Once you are done resting the turkey, I will link up with youto discuss more steps.  Talk to you in about 20 to 25 minutes. <|EOS|> [user] Hi there, 20 minutes past and my stomach has literally starting to growl.  Can I eat NOW?? or is there something else that I have to do.  It feels and smells like it's done.  My belly thinks it's done too. <|EOS|> [system] Yes, yes, you can take a bite now and so can the rest of your friends and family, that's IF you decide to share it with them... lol.  If yo uhappen to have some left overs please wrap it up in aluminuium fiol , plastic foil or a very shallow airtight container.  This will keep your turkey loegs fresh and juicy.  You are pretty much done now.   Do you have any questions or concerns about anything? <|EOS|> [user] Yum, yum, yum.  I'm glad I finally learned how to do this and it really isn't that hard.

{"Context": "[system] Hi my name is John, How can I help you with this recipe? <|EOS|> [user] Hi, what's the easiest way to melt butter? I don't have a microwave.", "File": "126-225-201_selfchat.json", "Index": 636, "Knowledge": "Review the ingredients. <|step|> Every cookie dough recipe is a little different, so you should carefully review the specific recipe before proceeding. That said, most cookie dough recipes share the same basic ingredients in various proportions. Use the following guidelines to prepare cookie dough if you have a list of ingredients but lost the instructions that go with it. Most cookie dough recipes use some type of fat, sugar, eggs, and flour. Salt and baking powder are not used as consistently but do appear in many cookie dough recipes as leavening agents. Butter is the most common fat used, but shortening is also used frequently. Butter creates crisper, thinner cookies, while shortening creates soft, cake-like cookies. Vanilla extract also appears in most cookie dough recipes. Note that ready-to-eat or safe-to-eat cookies doughs don't contain eggs. <|EOS|> Soften the butter. <|step|> For best results, cut the cold butter into pieces and allow it to sit out at room temperature up to 30 minutes. The butter should be soft enough for you to leave an indentation with your thumb. Do not let the butter melt, though. Softened butter and margarine are easier to combine with other ingredients. If running short on time, you can microwave the cold butter for 10-second intervals until softened. If using margarine instead of butter, make sure that the margarine contains 80 percent vegetable oil or more. <|EOS|> Beat the butter and shortening together. <|step|> If your recipe calls for both butter and shortening, you should cream them together with an electric mixer until smooth. Even if your recipe only contains one or the other, you should still consider beating the fat with an electric mixture until smooth. Doing so removes any lumps and allows the fat to mix into the dough more effectively. <|EOS|> Add the sugar, baking powder, and salt. <|step|> Use an electric mixer to beat in the sugar, salt, and baking powder or baking soda. These ingredients should be completely combined with the fat. Cream these ingredients until the consistency and color both become lighter. This process creates air bubbles in the dough, thereby creating lighter cookies. Do not overbeat the dough, though, especially at this stage. <|EOS|> Add the eggs and vanilla extract. <|step|> Use an electric mixer to beat the eggs in one at a time on medium speed. Add the vanilla extract simultaneously or immediately after. Beat until you remove all streaks of egg or extract. Consider leaving the eggs out at room temperature for 30 minutes before use. This makes it easier for the eggs to incorporate air in the batter, which creates lighter cookies. <|EOS|> Gradually add the flour. <|step|> Use an electric mixer to beat in as much flour as possible, adding it slowly to the dough. When the mixer begins to strain, switch to a wooden spoon and stir the remaining flour into the dough that way. Stand mixers can usually take the strain, so you may not need to do any stirring if using one. Hand-held mixers are less durable, though, and should be swapped out toward the end to prevent the mixer from burning out completely. Any chocolate chips, nuts, or similar ingredients should be stirred in after the flour. <|EOS|> Save or bake as directed. <|step|> Saving instructions and baking instructions vary, so it is best to find instructions that are specific to your recipe. Generally, you can wrap your dough tightly in plastic wrap and save it in the refrigerator for a week. Many cookie recipes bake around 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) for 8 to 15 minutes.", "Response": "No problem if you don't have a microwave.

Most cookie dough recipes use some type of fat, sugar, eggs, and flour. Salt and baking powder are not used as consistently but do appear in many cookie dough recipes as leavening agents.

Note that ready-to-eat or safe-to-eat cookies doughs don't contain eggs. <|EOS|> Soften the butter. <|step|> For best results, cut the cold butter into pieces and allow it to sit out at room temperature up to 30 minutes. The butter should be soft enough for you to leave an indentation with your thumb. Do not let the butter melt, though. Softened butter and margarine are easier to combine with other ingredients. If running short on time, you can microwave the cold butter for 10-second intervals until softened. If using margarine instead of butter, make sure that the margarine contains 80 percent vegetable oil or more. <|EOS|> Beat the butter and shortening together. <|step|> If your recipe calls for both butter and shortening, you should cream them together with an electric mixer until smooth. Even if your recipe only contains one or the other, you should still consider beating the fat with an electric mixture until smooth. Doing so removes any lumps and allows the fat to mix into the dough more effectively. <|EOS|> Add the sugar, baking powder, and salt. <|step|> Use an electric mixer to beat in the sugar, salt, and baking powder or baking soda. These ingredients should be completely combined with the fat. Cream these ingredients until the consistency and color both become lighter. This process creates air bubbles in the dough, thereby creating lighter cookies. Do not overbeat the dough, though, especially at this stage. <|EOS|> Add the eggs and vanilla extract. <|step|> Use an electric mixer to beat the eggs in one at a time on medium speed. Add the vanilla extract simultaneously or immediately after. Beat until you remove all streaks of egg or extract. Consider leaving the eggs out at room temperature for 30 minutes before use. This makes it easier for the eggs to incorporate air in the batter, which creates lighter cookies. <|EOS|> Gradually add the flour. <|step|> Use an electric mixer to beat in as much flour as possible, adding it slowly to the dough. When the mixer begins to strain, switch to a wooden spoon and stir the remaining flour into the dough that way. Stand mixers can usually take the strain, so you may not need to do any stirring if using one. Hand-held mixers are less durable, though, and should be swapped out toward the end to prevent the mixer from burning out completely. Any chocolate chips, nuts, or similar ingredients should be stirred in after the flour. <|EOS|> Save or bake as directed. <|step|> Saving instructions and baking instructions vary, so it is best to find instructions that are specific to your recipe. Generally, you can wrap your dough tightly in plastic wrap and save it in the refrigerator for a week. Many cookie recipes bake around 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) for 8 to 15 minutes.", "Response": "The chat has ended.", "Current_step_idx": 6, "Next_step_idx": 6, "intents": "thank"}

While not strictly necessary, it's a good idea to sift the flour into the bowl to remove any lumps and make it less dense. If necessary, you could use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, but the resulting wrappers might be slightly less durable. <|EOS|> Beat in the egg and water. <|step|> Add the beaten egg and cold water to the center of the flour well. Gradually beat these ingredients into the flour until well-combined. The resulting dough should be very smooth.

Avoid sprinkling too much flour directly over the dough since adding too much excess flour may result in denser, less crispy wrappers. If the dough seems too sticky as you work with it, try refrigerating it for a longer period of time. <|EOS|> Cut the dough into squares. <|step|> Use a smooth knife to cut the dough into 12 squares, each measuring 4 inches (10 cm) on all sides. You'll need to make four columns across the top and three rows along the side to produce 12 evenly sized squares. <|EOS|> Flatten each square. <|step|> Using a floured rolling pin, flatten each square until it measures roughly 6 inches (15 cm) on all sides. <|EOS|> Use as needed. <|step|> Stack the wrappers, layering plastic wrap or parchment paper in between each one.

Bye by", "File": "125-218-194_selfchat.json", "Index": 717, "Knowledge": "Form a flour well. <|step|> Place the wheat-based bread flour in a large bowl, using your hands or a spoon to form a well in the center. While not strictly necessary, it's a good idea to sift the flour into the bowl to remove any lumps and make it less dense. If necessary, you could use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, but the resulting wrappers might be slightly less durable. <|EOS|> Beat in the egg and water. <|step|> Add the beaten egg and cold water to the center of the flour well. Gradually beat these ingredients into the flour until well-combined. The resulting dough should be very smooth. Start by adding only 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of cold water, then gradually add more water as needed to achieve the desired texture. Use cold water only; warm water may make the dough too sticky to work with. <|EOS|> Knead the dough. <|step|> Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface. Knead it for several minutes, or until it becomes notably more elastic. If there's enough room in the bowl, you could knead the dough in the bowl during this step. You should handle the dough with well-floured hands either way. <|EOS|> Chill overnight. <|step|> Return the dough to the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, then place the dough into your refrigerator. Let it remain there overnight. While it chills, the dough should become firmer and easier to handle. You need to give it at least 4 hours, but 8 to 12 hours will be best. <|EOS|> Roll out the dough. <|step|> Turn the chilled dough out onto a well-floured surface. Roll the batch into a rectangle measuring roughly 12 inches (30.5 cm) wide and 16 inches (40.6 cm) long. You also need to apply generous amounts of flour to the rolling pin used for this step. Avoid sprinkling too much flour directly over the dough since adding too much excess flour may result in denser, less crispy wrappers. If the dough seems too sticky as you work with it, try refrigerating it for a longer period of time. <|EOS|> Cut the dough into squares. <|step|> Use a smooth knife to cut the dough into 12 squares, each measuring 4 inches (10 cm) on all sides. You'll need to make four columns across the top and three rows along the side to produce 12 evenly sized squares. <|EOS|> Flatten each square. <|step|> Using a floured rolling pin, flatten each square until it measures roughly 6 inches (15 cm) on all sides. <|EOS|> Use as needed. <|step|> Stack the wrappers, layering plastic wrap or parchment paper in between each one. Tightly wrap the entire stack with additional plastic wrap and refrigerate the wrappers until you're ready to use them. These wrappers will dry out if stored for prolonged periods, so you should try to use them within several days.", "Response": "I'm glad I was able to help.", "Current_step_idx": 4, "Next_step_idx": 4, "intents": "thank; goodbye"}

The recipe is fairly simple, but you may need to go to a specialty Indian food store for ingredients if your local supermarket doesn’t carry them. For vermicelli kheer that serves four people you need the following ingredients: ½ cup roasted vermicelli; 2 ½ cups warmed whole milk; ½ cup sweetened, condensed milk; 2-3 tablespoons mixed, dried fruits and nuts; ½ teaspoon cardamom powder; 1 tablespoon ghee; a pinch of saffron. If you live near an Indian food store, you can buy roasted vermicelli so that you don’t need to roast it separately. The amount of milk you use can increase or decrease depending on how creamy you want your kheer.

If you don’t live near an Indian food store or simply just prefer to do the work yourself, you’ll also need to roast your vermicelli.

When the ghee has melted in the heated pan, add the nuts and brown slightly. Then add the raisins until they puff up.

Make sure to not leave the pan at this stage so that it doesn’t burn. To the roasted vermicelli in the pan, add the milk and a few of the nuts.

After you’ve added the condensed milk, cardamom, and saffron, allow the mixture to cook for a few more minutes and thicken to a desired consistency.

The chocolate will start to melt and become soft, and the marshmallow will puff up. If the marshmallow puffs up too much, heat the s'more at 5-second intervals.

{"Context": "[system] Hi, When you're ready to get started, turn your oven on to 350F (175C). You'll need a few sheets of parchment paper to lay on your baking sheets. Alternatively, you could use silicone baking mats. <|EOS|> [user] Great. I've got silicone baking mats. I'll use those. What are the first ingredients I'll need?", "File": "136-249-222_selfchat.json", "Index": 813, "Knowledge": "Preheat the oven and prepare baking sheets. <|step|> Turn on the oven to 350 degrees F (175 C). Get out a few baking sheets and tear out several sheets of parchment paper. Lay one piece of parchment paper on each baking sheet. Set the prepared sheets aside while you make the cookies. If you don't have parchment paper, you could also use a silicone baking mat. <|EOS|> Whisk together the dry ingredients. <|step|> Mix together the dry ingredients in a medium sized bowl. You'll need to whisk 2 cups (260 g) of whole-wheat flour, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder until they're combined. Set the dry mixture aside. Whisk the ingredients for at least 30 seconds. This ensures that the baking powder is evenly distributed among the flour. <|EOS|> Cream the butter, sugar, and cream cheese. <|step|> Place 10 tablespoons (142 g) of softened butter, 1/2 cup (100 g) of granulated sugar, and 1 ounce (30 g) of softened cream cheese into a large mixing bowl. Use a stand or electric mixer to beat the ingredients on high speed for several minutes. The mixture should look light and fluffy. Your butter and cream cheese must be soft. If they're still cold, they won't cream and you'll have lumps in the cookie dough. <|EOS|> Add the egg and vanilla. <|step|> Turn the mixer down to low speed and add 1 large egg and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the creamed butter, cream cheese, and sugar mixture. Beat the mixture until the egg and vanilla are completely combined. If you'd like to flavor the cookies with something else, consider leaving out the vanilla extract. Instead, you could use almond, lemon, peppermint, or orange extract. <|EOS|> Combine and chill the whole-wheat sugar cookie dough. <|step|> Keep the mixer running on low speed and slowly add the dry ingredients. Beat the sugar cookie dough just until it's combined and you no longer see pockets of flour. Scoop the dough onto plastic wrap and shape it into a disk. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for one hour. Chilling is important because it will make the cookies easier to roll and will prevent them from being tough. <|EOS|> Roll and cut out the cookies. <|step|> Sprinkle your work surface with a little bit of flour. Remove the chilled dough from the fridge and roll the disk until it's 1/4-inch (6 mm) thick. Use cookie cutters to stamp out cookies from the dough. Reroll the scraps and keep cutting out cookies until you've used all of the dough. You should get about 32 cookies. Use cookie cutters that are about 2 to 3-inches (5 to 7 cm) in size. <|EOS|> Bake the cookies. <|step|> Arrange the cookie cutouts on the prepared baking sheets. Ensure that there's at least 1-inch (2.5 cm) of space between each cookie so they have room to expand as they bake. Bake the cookies for about 12 minutes. Remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack. The cookies should be lightly brown around the edges once they've finished cooking. <|EOS|> Consider frosting the cookies. <|step|> For a really simple frosting, place powdered sugar into a small mixing bowl. Add a little bit of milk or cream to the sugar and stir it with a fork until the sugar dissolves. Adjust the liquid to get a spreadable frosting consistency. Frost the cookies once they're totally cool. You can also tint the frosting different colors. Consider using food gel so that it won't make the frosting too runny.

This ensures that the baking powder is evenly distributed among the flour. <|EOS|> Cream the butter, sugar, and cream cheese. <|step|> Place 10 tablespoons (142 g) of softened butter, 1/2 cup (100 g) of granulated sugar, and 1 ounce (30 g) of softened cream cheese into a large mixing bowl. Use a stand or electric mixer to beat the ingredients on high speed for several minutes. The mixture should look light and fluffy. Your butter and cream cheese must be soft.

Remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack. The cookies should be lightly brown around the edges once they've finished cooking. <|EOS|> Consider frosting the cookies. <|step|> For a really simple frosting, place powdered sugar into a small mixing bowl.

Get out a few baking sheets and tear out several sheets of parchment paper. Lay one piece of parchment paper on each baking sheet. Set the prepared sheets aside while you make the cookies. If you don't have parchment paper, you could also use a silicone baking mat. <|EOS|> Whisk together the dry ingredients. <|step|> Mix together the dry ingredients in a medium sized bowl. You'll need to whisk 2 cups (260 g) of whole-wheat flour, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder until they're combined. Set the dry mixture aside. Whisk the ingredients for at least 30 seconds. This ensures that the baking powder is evenly distributed among the flour. <|EOS|> Cream the butter, sugar, and cream cheese. <|step|> Place 10 tablespoons (142 g) of softened butter, 1/2 cup (100 g) of granulated sugar, and 1 ounce (30 g) of softened cream cheese into a large mixing bowl. Use a stand or electric mixer to beat the ingredients on high speed for several minutes. The mixture should look light and fluffy. Your butter and cream cheese must be soft. If they're still cold, they won't cream and you'll have lumps in the cookie dough. <|EOS|> Add the egg and vanilla. <|step|> Turn the mixer down to low speed and add 1 large egg and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the creamed butter, cream cheese, and sugar mixture. Beat the mixture until the egg and vanilla are completely combined. If you'd like to flavor the cookies with something else, consider leaving out the vanilla extract. Instead, you could use almond, lemon, peppermint, or orange extract. <|EOS|> Combine and chill the whole-wheat sugar cookie dough. <|step|> Keep the mixer running on low speed and slowly add the dry ingredients. Beat the sugar cookie dough just until it's combined and you no longer see pockets of flour. Scoop the dough onto plastic wrap and shape it into a disk. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for one hour. Chilling is important because it will make the cookies easier to roll and will prevent them from being tough. <|EOS|> Roll and cut out the cookies. <|step|> Sprinkle your work surface with a little bit of flour. Remove the chilled dough from the fridge and roll the disk until it's 1/4-inch (6 mm) thick. Use cookie cutters to stamp out cookies from the dough. Reroll the scraps and keep cutting out cookies until you've used all of the dough. You should get about 32 cookies. Use cookie cutters that are about 2 to 3-inches (5 to 7 cm) in size. <|EOS|> Bake the cookies. <|step|> Arrange the cookie cutouts on the prepared baking sheets. Ensure that there's at least 1-inch (2.5 cm) of space between each cookie so they have room to expand as they bake. Bake the cookies for about 12 minutes. Remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack. The cookies should be lightly brown around the edges once they've finished cooking. <|EOS|> Consider frosting the cookies. <|step|> For a really simple frosting, place powdered sugar into a small mixing bowl. Add a little bit of milk or cream to the sugar and stir it with a fork until the sugar dissolves. Adjust the liquid to get a spreadable frosting consistency. Frost the cookies once they're totally cool. You can also tint the frosting different colors. Consider using food gel so that it won't make the frosting too runny.

If you don't have parchment paper, you could also use a silicone baking mat. <|EOS|> Whisk together the dry ingredients. <|step|> Mix together the dry ingredients in a medium sized bowl. You'll need to whisk 2 cups (260 g) of whole-wheat flour, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder until they're combined. Set the dry mixture aside. Whisk the ingredients for at least 30 seconds. This ensures that the baking powder is evenly distributed among the flour. <|EOS|> Cream the butter, sugar, and cream cheese. <|step|> Place 10 tablespoons (142 g) of softened butter, 1/2 cup (100 g) of granulated sugar, and 1 ounce (30 g) of softened cream cheese into a large mixing bowl. Use a stand or electric mixer to beat the ingredients on high speed for several minutes. The mixture should look light and fluffy. Your butter and cream cheese must be soft. If they're still cold, they won't cream and you'll have lumps in the cookie dough. <|EOS|> Add the egg and vanilla. <|step|> Turn the mixer down to low speed and add 1 large egg and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the creamed butter, cream cheese, and sugar mixture. Beat the mixture until the egg and vanilla are completely combined. If you'd like to flavor the cookies with something else, consider leaving out the vanilla extract. Instead, you could use almond, lemon, peppermint, or orange extract. <|EOS|> Combine and chill the whole-wheat sugar cookie dough. <|step|> Keep the mixer running on low speed and slowly add the dry ingredients. Beat the sugar cookie dough just until it's combined and you no longer see pockets of flour. Scoop the dough onto plastic wrap and shape it into a disk. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for one hour. Chilling is important because it will make the cookies easier to roll and will prevent them from being tough. <|EOS|> Roll and cut out the cookies. <|step|> Sprinkle your work surface with a little bit of flour. Remove the chilled dough from the fridge and roll the disk until it's 1/4-inch (6 mm) thick. Use cookie cutters to stamp out cookies from the dough. Reroll the scraps and keep cutting out cookies until you've used all of the dough. You should get about 32 cookies. Use cookie cutters that are about 2 to 3-inches (5 to 7 cm) in size. <|EOS|> Bake the cookies. <|step|> Arrange the cookie cutouts on the prepared baking sheets. Ensure that there's at least 1-inch (2.5 cm) of space between each cookie so they have room to expand as they bake. Bake the cookies for about 12 minutes. Remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack. The cookies should be lightly brown around the edges once they've finished cooking. <|EOS|> Consider frosting the cookies. <|step|> For a really simple frosting, place powdered sugar into a small mixing bowl. Add a little bit of milk or cream to the sugar and stir it with a fork until the sugar dissolves. Adjust the liquid to get a spreadable frosting consistency. Frost the cookies once they're totally cool. You can also tint the frosting different colors. Consider using food gel so that it won't make the frosting too runny.

{"Context": "[system] Hi! What can I help you? <|EOS|> [user] I want to eat sweet potato mash.", "File": "225-622-535_pair.json", "Index": 839, "Knowledge": "Peel and cut the sweet potatoes. <|step|> Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin from the sweet potatoes, then rinse the bare sweet potatoes with running water. Cut each one into 2-inch (5-cm) chunks. Since you'll be removing the skins from the sweet potatoes, there's no need to scrub them clean beforehand. A simple rinse after peeling the spuds should be enough to remove any residual dirt from the flesh. Try to keep the pieces evenly sized to promote consistent cooking. If you cut the pieces much smaller than instructed, they may disintegrate. If you cut them too large, they will take longer to cook. <|EOS|> Cover with water. <|step|> Place the cubed sweet potatoes in a large stockpot. Add enough cold water to cover them by about 1 inch (2.5 cm). <|EOS|> Boil the sweet potatoes until tender. <|step|> Place stockpot on the stove over medium-high heat. Bring the water to a boil, then cook the sweet potatoes for 15 to 20 minutes. Test the sweet potatoes for doneness by piercing one chunk with the tines of a fork. If the sweet potatoes are ready, the fork should slide into the chunk easily and nearly break it apart. <|EOS|> Drain the water. <|step|> Pour the contents of the stockpot through a colander to drain any water, then return the chunks of sweet potato to the pot. Keep the stockpot on a heat-resistant surface but do not return it to the stove. It's best to return the sweet potatoes to the empty stockpot than to place them in a separate bowl. The residual heat should help dry any remaining water lingering on the surface of the sweet potato chunks. <|EOS|> Mash with milk and butter. <|step|> Roughly mash the softened sweet potatoes using an electric hand mixer, immersion blender, potato masher, or fork. Add milk and butter, then continue mashing until combined. If you prefer chunky sweet potato mash, use a fork or potato masher and limit the amount of milk and butter you add.

We've provided a few sample recipes above. For stir fry beginners, it doesn't get much easier than the \"Basic\" sauce at the top of the list. Not only is it easy to make, but also mild and pleasing to the taste. To begin, pour all of your ingredients except cornstarch into a bowl that's big enough to accommodate them. <|EOS|> Mix your ingredients (minus corn starch) thoroughly. <|step|> Using a spoon, an electric mixer, or another mixing utensil, give your liquid sauce ingredients and sugar a quick stirring until they make a mixture that's uniform in color and texture. If you're using the \"Basic\" recipe above, make sure the sugar in the recipe is dissolved before proceeding or it may give the dish uneven \"sweet spots\" when it's added. If you're having a hard time getting the sugar to dissolve, try heating the sauce up somewhat — as a rule of basic chemistry, liquids dissolve substances like sugar more easily when they're warm. However, you won't want to heat the sauce to the point that it's very hot or boiling — this can caramelize the sugar, giving the sauce a \"sticky\" texture and an odd taste. <|EOS|> Add corn starch to thicken as necessary. <|step|> Finally, add your corn starch and stir to combine. You have some freedom with this step — corn starch is a thickening agent, so the more you add, the thicker your sauce will become. The ideal thickness of your sauce is usually a matter of personal taste. The 1/2 teaspoon recommended in the recipe above should give a fairly liquid sauce, but anything from zero corn starch to twice the recommended portion is acceptable. Note that this thickening rule applies to the rest of the recipes in this article as well. Though it may not be explicitly mentioned below, adding additional corn starch to any of the following recipes will make a thicker sauce, while removing corn starch from the recipe will make a thinner sauce. <|EOS|> Alternatively, mix in a jar. <|step|> If you don't have any stirring utensils handy or you want to prep your sauce for storage in the fridge, consider mixing it in a jar. With this method, all you need to do is add your sauce ingredients to a jar, close the lid tight, and shake to combine. Make sure the lid is secure — a big mess is in store if it pops off!. Other containers work just as well as jars as long as they can achieve an airtight seal. For instance, plastic fridge containers (like Tupperware, etc.) work great in a pinch. <|EOS|> Add sauce during the stir fry process. <|step|> Once your sauce is done, stir fry your meat, vegetables, tofu, etc. as you normally would by heating a pan to high heat, adding oil, and then tossing your ingredients in. Once your stir fry ingredients have achieved a good sear and are more or less finished cooking, pour your sauce in. Your sauce should quickly heat. Within about 30 seconds to a minute, remove the pan from heat and serve! Another good option is to use your sauce for dipping. In this case, keep it cool and separate from the other ingredients in its own bowl.

{"Context": "[system] Hello! We will be making simple mashed potatoes today. Have you chosen your potatoes, or do you have any questions? <|EOS|> [user] Hello, thank you! Yes, I've got a few kinds of potatoes in the house, and I'm not sure which of them is going to be best. Do you have any advice?", "File": "142-262-231_selfchat.json", "Index": 867, "Knowledge": "Choose your potatoes. <|step|> There are a few basic options when it comes to buying potatoes: baking, boiling, and all-purpose potatoes. All have different qualities when it comes to flavor and texture. Baking potatoes, such as Russets, are high in starch which creates light and fluffy mashed potatoes. Boiling potatoes, such as red potatoes, are considered waxy which means they hold their shape and may create lumpy mashed potatoes. All-purpose potatoes, such as Yukon Golds, fall in between boiling and baking potatoes in terms of texture. They do offer a butterier flavor than Russets. <|EOS|> Wash the potatoes. <|step|> Use cold water and gently scrub the entire potato. Look for dark patches where dirt might have settled. If you wash the potatoes in a bowl of water, be sure to rinse them before cutting. You can use a small brush specifically designated for cleaning potatoes or produce. This will help scrub away any dirt that's firmly stuck. <|EOS|> Prepare your potatoes for boiling. <|step|> You can cook the potatoes with the skins on or you can peel them before cutting them. Simply cut your potato into quarters or cubes. Leaving the skins on will give your mashed potatoes more texture. For this reason, you should consider using Yukon Golds, which have a thinner peel than Russets. <|EOS|> Cook your potatoes. <|step|> Place your prepared potatoes in a large saucepot and fill with cold water. The potatoes should be covered by an inch or two of water. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to a lively simmer and cook for 10 to 20 minutes. The potatoes are done when you stick a fork into them and they start to fall apart. You can salt your water for extra flavor, just as though you're cooking pasta. The potatoes will absorb the salt as they cook. Avoid using hot water and covering your pot with a lid. This will make the potatoes cook unevenly and can lead to gluey potatoes. <|EOS|> Prepare your liquid. <|step|> While the potatoes are cooking, heat up chicken stock or milk until warm and get some butter out of the fridge. Use chicken stock if you'd like the potato flavor to really shine. Milk, ranging from skim to whole, will make creamier potatoes. Heating your liquid will keep the mashed potatoes hotter for longer. Warm liquid is also absorbed better by the potatoes. <|EOS|> Drain and prepare the potatoes. <|step|> Use a strainer or lift the potatoes out with a slotted spoon. Return the cooked potatoes to your pot on the stove. Add your room temperature butter and start mashing the potatoes. The best tool for mashing rustic potatoes is a simple potato masher. Avoid mashing too much or you'll be left with more of a puree. You may want to leave small chunks and skin somewhat intact. <|EOS|> Add your warm liquid. <|step|> Gradually add some of your warm stock or milk. Stir gently and add a bit more liquid if your potatoes are still loose. Keep adding liquid gradually until the potatoes bind together. Avoid adding all your liquid at once. You could end up with too much liquid which makes mushy mashed potatoes. Your potatoes will need more or less liquid depending on potato type and level of starchiness. <|EOS|> Season and serve. <|step|> Taste the potatoes and add salt, pepper, and/or more butter, as you like.

Boiling potatoes, such as red potatoes, are considered waxy which means they hold their shape and may create lumpy mashed potatoes. All-purpose potatoes, such as Yukon Golds, fall in between boiling and baking potatoes in terms of texture. They do offer a butterier flavor than Russets. <|EOS|> Wash the potatoes. <|step|> Use cold water and gently scrub the entire potato. Look for dark patches where dirt might have settled.

This will help scrub away any dirt that's firmly stuck. <|EOS|> Prepare your potatoes for boiling. <|step|> You can cook the potatoes with the skins on or you can peel them before cutting them. Simply cut your potato into quarters or cubes. Leaving the skins on will give your mashed potatoes more texture. For this reason, you should consider using Yukon Golds, which have a thinner peel than Russets. <|EOS|> Cook your potatoes. <|step|> Place your prepared potatoes in a large saucepot and fill with cold water.

Use chicken stock if you'd like the potato flavor to really shine. Milk, ranging from skim to whole, will make creamier potatoes. Heating your liquid will keep the mashed potatoes hotter for longer. Warm liquid is also absorbed better by the potatoes. <|EOS|> Drain and prepare the potatoes. <|step|> Use a strainer or lift the potatoes out with a slotted spoon.

The length of time that it takes to pan-fry the scrapple depends on the thickness of the slices. Thin slices can cook in as quickly as 3 minutes, while thick slices may take up to 10 minutes on each side. Watching for the crispy edges and browning color is the best way to monitor how the scrapple is cooking. <|EOS|> Remove the scrapple from the pan when it is brown and crispy. <|step|> Once the scrapple slices are cooked, use a kitchen flipper to remove them from the heat. Place the scrapple on a plate, and make sure it is lined with a paper tower to absorb any extra grease. You could also use a frying fork to remove the slices from the pan if you prefer.

The thickness of the slices depends on your own preference, however thinner slices tend to cook more quickly. While 1/4 in (0.6 cm) slices are the most common, try ½ in (1.3 cm) thick slices if you prefer them to be a bit chunkier. For even thicker slices, try ¾ in (2 cm). Bear in mind that these will need to be cooked for longer though. <|EOS|> Dip each scrapple slice into 1 cup (110 g) of instant flour. <|step|> Pour the instant flour into a bowl and coat each slice fully in the flour. Dip each slice individually to make sure that every side is coated in instant flour. <|EOS|> Season the slices with salt and pepper to taste. <|step|> Use table salt and freshly ground black pepper to sprinkle over each slice. Make sure you season both sides of each slice. <|EOS|> Heat 1 tbsp (14 g) of butter in a skillet or a deep frying pan. <|step|> Using a medium heat for the frying pan is the key to making delicious, crispy scrapple. Make sure that the butter has melted before you put the scrapple in the pan. Don’t add too much butter to the pan, as the contents of the scrapple has enough grease. Too much butter will make the scrapple too oily when it has finished cooking. Since the scrapple in the pan will be producing grease, this makes it less likely to burn. <|EOS|> Pan-fry the scrapple slices for 3 minutes on the first side. <|step|> Place each slice in the pan, and fry them until you can see the edges of the underside starting to look brown and crispy. Make sure that there is ½ in (1.3 cm) gap between each slice in the pan.

Lay the sausage on a cutting board and cut it into slices roughly half an inch thick using a sharp knife. The thicker slices will need to cook longer, but there will be less chance that the sausage filling will crumble as it heats. You can also begin slicing the sausage while it’s still in the plastic wrapper and remove the plastic and the skin together. Blood sausages like black pudding have a more delicate consistency because they contain very little actual meat. The oats and grains inside will not hold up as well to cooking as meatier sausages. <|EOS|> Remove the skin. <|step|> Make a small incision at the edge of each slice with your knife and then peel away the skin. Be careful not to damage the sausage as you are cutting and peeling. Removing the skin the black pudding prior to cooking will allow it to get more evenly done, and will also make it easier to eat. Use a sharpened knife to keep from mashing the sausage as you slice it. <|EOS|> Place the pudding slices in a hot frying pan. <|step|> Turn the stove on to a medium heat and begin heating a pan large enough to hold 2-3 pudding slices. If you prefer, you can use an ounce of butter or a tablespoon of oil to fry the black pudding, though this is not necessary due to the high fat content of the sausage. Place the slices flat in the pan and let them start cooking. Black pudding will cook just fine in its own fat, much like bacon or other varieties of sausage. Butter and oil can be used for flavor and to give the outer layer an extra crispy finish. For a traditional English breakfast, add other ingredients to the pan that can be fried at the same time—eggs, bacon, potatoes, and other sausages are all fair game. <|EOS|> Fry for 3-4 minutes on each side. <|step|> Fry the black pudding slices for 3-4 minutes before turning them. Keep a close eye on them as they cook—because of their dark color, it can be hard to tell when they are done.
