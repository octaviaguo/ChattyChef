{"Context": "[system] Great, then once the 5 minutes is up you should have a nice blond colour. Then go ahead and add room temperature roux to your hot mixture and mix vigorously.

Let me know when it has become room temperature and we can move onto the final steps. <|EOS|> [user] Ok, I have moved my saucepan off the stove to a cold spot to set. it is cooling down, but is still pretty warm. <|EOS|> [system] You're almost there! Keep in mind that you can certainly add hot roux to cold or warm sauces right away but you shouldn't add hot roux to a hot liquid as it will create lumps that cannot be fixed unless you strain them out. It can be quite a headache! How is the temperature of the mixture now? <|EOS|> [user] It is finally feeling like it is room temperature. What do I do next? <|EOS|> [system] Perfect. Go ahead and turn the stove heat up to high and place the mixture back on the stove. Bring the mixture to a boil. Then monitor the thickness of the mixture. The longer it boils for, the thicker the mixture will become. How do you prefer the mixture? <|EOS|> [user] I like it thick enough to spoon out of the saucepan, and it should be fairly thick, but not quite too thick. How long should I have it on high heat to achieve this consistency? <|EOS|> [system] It should take you at least 1 minute. I would try 2 minutes, but ensure that you monitor the mixture during this time. <|EOS|> [user] It has been on high heat for about 2 minutes, so I will turn off the heat and let it cool a little bit. It appears to be the exact thickness I prefer! How does it store? <|EOS|> [system] Perfect. You can go ahead and use the mixture. If there is any leftover please pour it onto a baking sheet or ice cube tray. It can be placed into the refrigerator to cool overnight or until hard. You can freeze leftovers in an air tight container for up to a month and roux made with oil is able to be at room temperature for about 2-4 weeks. <|EOS|> [user] Thank you!

You will know the butter is heated when you can sprinkle a pinch of flour over it and the mixture slowly starts to bubble. You can substitute oil for the butter to make it a dairy-free option. <|EOS|> Whisk 1 tbsp (9 grams) of flour into the butter until a thick paste forms. <|step|> Keep the mixture over medium heat. Whisk it constantly while the flour begins to bubble. As the flour and butter cook, they will become smooth and start to thin. <|EOS|> Stir the mixture while you cook it for 5 minutes. <|step|> Roux does not take long to prepare. It is done when the flour loses its raw smell, and it becomes a thin, white paste. Use roux to thicken milk-based sauces, such as cheese sauce for macaroni and cheese. You can let the roux cook longer to get a blond, brown, or dark brown roux, but these are commonly used to thicken soups and chowders, not sauces. <|EOS|> Add room temperature roux to your hot liquid. <|step|> Whisk the mixture vigorously. Cool your hot roux in the fridge or let it sit out on the counter until it reaches room temperature. Hot roux can be added to cold or warm sauces right away. Do not add hot roux to a hot liquid, as it will create lumps that can not be removed unless you use a strainer. <|EOS|> Boil the sauce 1 minute on high. <|step|> Turn the stove heat up to high and allow your sauce to come to a boil. The mixture will only take about 1 minute to begin thickening. Keep your sauce at a boil until it has reached your desired thickness. <|EOS|> Pour any leftover roux onto a baking sheet or ice cube tray. <|step|> Place your roux in the refrigerator to let it cool overnight or until it has hardened.

Note -- check if it already has salt in it before adding separately. 1/2 teaspoon (7ml) oregano, garlic and onion powder, cracked red pepper, rosemary, and/or thyme\n1 packet powdered onion or mushroom soup mix. 1 Adobo chili mixture or spice packet, with salt. <|EOS|> Choose your ground meat and dump it into a big bowl. <|step|> Classically, meatballs are made from hamburger meat. But mixing things up, like the lovely Italian trio of beef, lamb, and veal, will lead to spectacular meatballs with little extra work. <|EOS|> Pour the egg, Parmesan, and bread crumbs in and mix thoroughly with your hands. <|step|> Plunge your hands in and really squeeze to mix everything up. If you're squeamish, a stiff spatula or wooden spoon will work as well. Just make sure that everything is evenly blended and you have a wet, seasoned pile of meat when done. If desired, add the small diced onion here as well. Onion, when cooked, is a savory-sweet complement to the meat. Once it looks well mixed, you can stop. Extra mixing isn't helpful, and the more you mix the meat, the tougher it gets. <|EOS|> Roll the meat into 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls. <|step|> You can make any size you want, but 1\" balls tend to brown nicely on the outside while cooking quickly enough on the inside. Grab a small pinch of meat and roll it between your palms to get nice round meatballs. If you make larger meatballs, you may need to cook them a little longer, lowering the heat to prevent burning. Smaller balls can dry out if cooked too long. They must hit high heat, brown, and then come off quickly before over-cooking.. <|EOS|> Fry the meatballs on the stovetop over medium heat until browned on all sides. <|step|> Use a little bit of oil and rotate the meatballs every few minutes until browned and cooked. If the outsides are done, but the insides are still soft, lower the heat and let them cook for an extra 2-3 minutes. For the best meatballs, let them cook in a 1/2\" (1-2 cm) of red sauce after they've browned -- they'll soak up some of the flavor and liquid to stay tender. A slow-cooker filled with sauce and meatballs can accomplish the same thing for beautifully rich, slow-cooked meatballs. To make them, add the sauce and meatballs to the cooker and cook on low heat for 6-8 hours. <|EOS|> Alternatively, bake meatballs for 20-30 min at 350F (175C), turning once or twice. <|step|> Roasted meatballs bring out a rich, crisp flavor and texture, and create far less mess than stovetop cooking. Your biggest worry in the oven is drying out -- be sure to check the smaller balls regularly and take them out as soon as they are cooked all the way through.

Note -- check if it already has salt in it before adding separately. 1/2 teaspoon (7ml) oregano, garlic and onion powder, cracked red pepper, rosemary, and/or thyme\n1 packet powdered onion or mushroom soup mix. 1 Adobo chili mixture or spice packet, with salt. <|EOS|> Choose your ground meat and dump it into a big bowl. <|step|> Classically, meatballs are made from hamburger meat. But mixing things up, like the lovely Italian trio of beef, lamb, and veal, will lead to spectacular meatballs with little extra work. <|EOS|> Pour the egg, Parmesan, and bread crumbs in and mix thoroughly with your hands. <|step|> Plunge your hands in and really squeeze to mix everything up. If you're squeamish, a stiff spatula or wooden spoon will work as well. Just make sure that everything is evenly blended and you have a wet, seasoned pile of meat when done. If desired, add the small diced onion here as well. Onion, when cooked, is a savory-sweet complement to the meat. Once it looks well mixed, you can stop. Extra mixing isn't helpful, and the more you mix the meat, the tougher it gets. <|EOS|> Roll the meat into 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls. <|step|> You can make any size you want, but 1\" balls tend to brown nicely on the outside while cooking quickly enough on the inside. Grab a small pinch of meat and roll it between your palms to get nice round meatballs. If you make larger meatballs, you may need to cook them a little longer, lowering the heat to prevent burning. Smaller balls can dry out if cooked too long. They must hit high heat, brown, and then come off quickly before over-cooking.. <|EOS|> Fry the meatballs on the stovetop over medium heat until browned on all sides. <|step|> Use a little bit of oil and rotate the meatballs every few minutes until browned and cooked. If the outsides are done, but the insides are still soft, lower the heat and let them cook for an extra 2-3 minutes. For the best meatballs, let them cook in a 1/2\" (1-2 cm) of red sauce after they've browned -- they'll soak up some of the flavor and liquid to stay tender. A slow-cooker filled with sauce and meatballs can accomplish the same thing for beautifully rich, slow-cooked meatballs. To make them, add the sauce and meatballs to the cooker and cook on low heat for 6-8 hours. <|EOS|> Alternatively, bake meatballs for 20-30 min at 350F (175C), turning once or twice. <|step|> Roasted meatballs bring out a rich, crisp flavor and texture, and create far less mess than stovetop cooking.

If you're using a charcoal grill, fill a chimney with briquettes and light them. Dump the briquettes onto 1 side of the grill once they're hot and lightly covered with ash.Variation: If you'd rather broil the tuna, turn the broiler to \"High\" and place the tuna about 4 inches (10 cm) below the heating element.

If you're using a broiler, preheat it for at least 5 minutes before cooking the tuna steaks. <|EOS|> Take the steaks out of the bag and season them with salt and pepper. <|step|> Remove the marinated tuna steaks from the refrigerator and transfer them from the marinade to a plate. Then, sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 g) of salt and 1/4 teaspoon (0.5 g) of ground pepper over the steaks. Discard the marinade once you remove the tuna steaks from the bag. <|EOS|> Oil the grill grate and lay the tuna steaks on it. <|step|> Dip a paper towel in a little vegetable oil and gather it into a ball. Grip the balled up paper towel with tongs and brush the towel over the grill grates so they're lightly greased. Lay the 4 tuna steaks onto the grill grate so the steaks aren't touching and close the lid. If you're using a charcoal grill, you can put the tuna steaks directly over the coals. <|EOS|> Grill the tuna for 3 to 4 minutes. <|step|> Set a timer so you don't accidentally overcook 1 side of the tuna steaks. They should become browned on the bottom side that's exposed to the heat. <|EOS|> Flip the tuna steaks and grill them for another 3 to 4 minutes. <|step|> Once the tuna steaks are halfway cooked, carefully lift the lid and use tongs to flip each steak over. Put the lid back on and finish cooking the tuna steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes. The tuna should be a little flaky near the edges, but slightly pink in the center. Plan on grilling the tuna steaks for around 8 minutes total if you'd like medium-rare fish. If you want them cooked medium, add an extra 1 to 2 minutes to the grilling time. Avoid cooking the tuna steaks beyond medium since the steaks will become dry and crumbly if they're overcooked. <|EOS|> Remove the tuna steaks and rest them for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. <|step|> Use tongs to carefully transfer the tuna steaks from the grill to a serving platter.

Put the lid back on and finish cooking the tuna steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes. The tuna should be a little flaky near the edges, but slightly pink in the center. Plan on grilling the tuna steaks for around 8 minutes total if you'd like medium-rare fish. If you want them cooked medium, add an extra 1 to 2 minutes to the grilling time. Avoid cooking the tuna steaks beyond medium since the steaks will become dry and crumbly if they're overcooked. <|EOS|> Remove the tuna steaks and rest them for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. <|step|> Use tongs to carefully transfer the tuna steaks from the grill to a serving platter.

Then, add 2 minced cloves of garlic and 2 teaspoons (1.5 g) of minced fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon (1 g) of dried thyme. Press out the air and seal the bag tightly. You can shake the marinade around to combine the ingredients. If you prefer, use your favorite marinade or just season the tuna with oil, salt, and pepper. <|EOS|> Add the tuna steaks and refrigerate them for up to 30 minutes. <|step|> Get out 4 tuna steaks that are around 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick and put them in the bag with the garlic herb marinade. Seal the bag and then turn the bag over a few times so the tuna steaks are coated. Avoid marinating the tuna steaks for more than 30 minutes or the acidic lemon juice could make them become mushy. <|EOS|> Heat a gas or charcoal grill to medium-high. <|step|> If you're using a gas grill, turn the burners to medium-high. If you're using a charcoal grill, fill a chimney with briquettes and light them. Dump the briquettes onto 1 side of the grill once they're hot and lightly covered with ash.Variation: If you'd rather broil the tuna, turn the broiler to \"High\" and place the tuna about 4 inches (10 cm) below the heating element. Then, broil the tuna for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. If you're using a broiler, preheat it for at least 5 minutes before cooking the tuna steaks. <|EOS|> Take the steaks out of the bag and season them with salt and pepper. <|step|> Remove the marinated tuna steaks from the refrigerator and transfer them from the marinade to a plate. Then, sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 g) of salt and 1/4 teaspoon (0.5 g) of ground pepper over the steaks. Discard the marinade once you remove the tuna steaks from the bag. <|EOS|> Oil the grill grate and lay the tuna steaks on it. <|step|> Dip a paper towel in a little vegetable oil and gather it into a ball. Grip the balled up paper towel with tongs and brush the towel over the grill grates so they're lightly greased. Lay the 4 tuna steaks onto the grill grate so the steaks aren't touching and close the lid. If you're using a charcoal grill, you can put the tuna steaks directly over the coals. <|EOS|> Grill the tuna for 3 to 4 minutes. <|step|> Set a timer so you don't accidentally overcook 1 side of the tuna steaks. They should become browned on the bottom side that's exposed to the heat. <|EOS|> Flip the tuna steaks and grill them for another 3 to 4 minutes. <|step|> Once the tuna steaks are halfway cooked, carefully lift the lid and use tongs to flip each steak over. Put the lid back on and finish cooking the tuna steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes. The tuna should be a little flaky near the edges, but slightly pink in the center. Plan on grilling the tuna steaks for around 8 minutes total if you'd like medium-rare fish. If you want them cooked medium, add an extra 1 to 2 minutes to the grilling time. Avoid cooking the tuna steaks beyond medium since the steaks will become dry and crumbly if they're overcooked. <|EOS|> Remove the tuna steaks and rest them for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. <|step|> Use tongs to carefully transfer the tuna steaks from the grill to a serving platter. Let the steaks rest while you get side dishes ready. Consider serving grilled tuna steaks with grilled vegetables, couscous, or a garden salad.

{"Context": "[system] That's great - welcome back! Okay. The next step is to take the pan out of the refrigerator and place it on your kitchen counter or nearby table. You will also need to grab a baking sheet and line it with parchment paper or wax paper (whichever you have available). Then grab a small ice cream scoop or teaspoon. You will use this item to start scooping chocolate from the pan. Once you scoop grab it with your hands and start shaping the scoop into balls and placing them on the baking sheet. <|EOS|> [user] How long should I spend shaping the scoop into balls? And should I space them out on the baking sheet? <|EOS|> [system] Try not to spend too long shaping the scoops in your hands as they will start to warm up from the heat in your hands. This can get messy quickly. Please make sure to space the balls out on the baking sheet so they are not touching and have some space between them. How do the balls look? are they holding together or melting? <|EOS|> [user] They are all about the same size and look round-ish. Some are melting a bit. How should I avoid the melting? I am trying not to roll them in my hands for very long. <|EOS|> [system] Try using some of that cocoa powder on your hands and then continuing to shape the balls. Alternatively you can run your hands under cold water, dry them off and then continue to shape the balls. Or you can try putting the chocolate back in the refrigerator, but this will add more time waiting (which you have said you don't want to do). Have the first two suggestions helped? Have the balls stopped melting? <|EOS|> [user] I definitely don't want to spend more time waiting! The first option has worked. They have stopped melting and are all on the baking sheet. What do we do now? Is it almost eating time? <|EOS|> [system] Great! Not yet, but almost there! Next you want to grab cocoa powder or any other topping you want to use to coat the balls. This can be chopped nuts, sprinkles, or anything you prefer. Then go ahead and place the topping into a small bowl and roll the truffles in the topping you have selected. Do this with each truffle. Are the truffles completed coated in the topping? <|EOS|> [user] I decided to use sprinkles. I have rolled all of the truffles into the sprinkles and each truffle looks pretty decently covered in sprinkles. Now do I get to eat them? <|EOS|> [system] Amazing! Yes, now you can eat them! Any truffles that you don't eat you can store in an airtight container and place them in the refrigerator. Don't leave them out too long at room temperature otherwise they will melt.

Let it boil for several minutes, or until you notice the mixture is starting to thicken. Stir the soup occasionally to keep it from burning on the bottom.

Spray a 10-cup capacity Bundt pan with baking spray. Ensure that you completely spray the inside of the pan, especially if your pan has an intricate design. Set your prepared pan aside while you make the cake batter. If you don't have baking spray, rub the inside of the pan with butter or coconut oil. Sprinkle about 1/4 of a cup of flour into the pan and shake it so that the inside is completely greased and floured. <|EOS|> Mix your wet ingredients. <|step|> If you have liquid coconut oil, pour 1 cup (200 g) of it into a large mixing bowl. Add 2 cups (450 g) of sugar, 1½ cups (350 ml) of milk, 6 large eggs, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and the zest from 2 limes into the mixing bowl and whisk until the wet ingredients are completely combined. Set this mixture aside. If your coconut oil is hard, measure it out and melt it in a small saucepan on the stove over low heat. You could also microwave it to liquefy it. <|EOS|> Stir together the dry ingredients. <|step|> In a separate mixing bowl, place 3½ cups (440 g) of flour, 3½ teaspoons of baking powder, ¼ teaspoon of grated nutmeg, and ½ teaspoon of salt. Whisk the dry ingredients together for about 30 seconds. Set the dry mixture aside. Whisking the dry ingredients ensures that they absorb the wet ingredients evenly. If you don't have a whisk, try sifting the dry ingredients into your bowl and stirring them. <|EOS|> Combine the wet and dry ingredients. <|step|> Sprinkle half of the dry mixture over the wet mixture. Take a spatula and fold the dry ingredients into the wet. Use your wrist to make a circular motion as you mix the ingredients. Add the rest of the dry mixture and finish folding the ingredients just until they're combined. Avoid stirring the batter too much or your cake will be tough and lose volume. <|EOS|> Bake the coconut oil pound cake. <|step|> Pour the batter into the prepared Bundt pan and use a spatula to smooth the top. Place the cake into the preheated oven and bake for about 1 hour. The cake will be golden brown and a tester will come out clean when the cake is finished. Since Bundt pans come in a variety of styles, your cake may take more or less time. If you need to add more time, set your timer for 5 minute increments. Keep checking until your cake is baked. <|EOS|> Cool the cake. <|step|> Remove the cake from the oven and leave it in the Bundt pan for 15 minutes.

{"Context": "[system] Hello, are you looking to learn a new recipe today? <|EOS|> [user] I want to learn how to make snow cones. Any suggestions?..", "File": "119-212-189_selfchat.json", "Index": 349, "Knowledge": "Crush ice to your blender. <|step|> You can add a little bit of ice to make a personal snow cone, a moderate amount of ice to serve a few people, or you could fill the blender with ice to create many servings. Be sure to follow the directions that came with your blender for best results. Depending on your blender, you might have many different settings to choose from when crushing your ice. In many cases, the puree feature will give you finely crushed ice, which is ideal for snow cones. You might like your snow cones with larger bits of ice. If so, you should blend your ice for a shorter period of time. Extra fine ice can be achieved by running the ice through the blender for longer. If you don't have a blender, you can put your ice in a heavy duty plastic bag and smash the ice with a rolling pin, hammer, or tenderizing mallet. You could also drop your ice repeatedly onto a hard surface to crush this ice, though this may take some time. You can also make your snow cone out of fresh, clean snow. You should exercise caution when doing this, though. Some snow may contain impurities that are unhealthy to consume. <|EOS|> Remove the ice from your blender. <|step|> You can leave your ice in the blender and scoop it out for the snow cones, but you should be careful that no one accidentally cuts themselves on the blades at the bottom of the blender. To prevent this, you may want to pour or scoop your ice from the blender into a bowl. For especially large parties, you might have to prepare several blender's worth of ice and put it in a bowl for serving. You can keep your ice frozen until you're ready to serve it by keeping the blended ice in your freezer. You shouldn't leave your blended ice in the freezer for too long. If you do, it may refreeze leaving you with a bowl of solid ice. <|EOS|> Scoop the ice into a cup. <|step|> Traditionally, at fairs and summer events, snow cones are served in paper cones. These are a cheap and disposable way of serving your snow cones, so you may want to use these yourself. You could also use a mug cup, a paper cup, or a plastic cup, depending on your preference. You should fill your cup until it is full of crushed ice. You can use a large serving spoon, but you may want to use an ice cream scoop to give your snow cones a rounded shape. <|EOS|> Drizzle flavoring over your snow cone. <|step|> There are many different ways you can flavor your snow cone. You can use juice, soda, or specially made syrups. In most cases, one to two tablespoons per two scoops of ice should be enough to flavor your snow cone. Be careful not to add too much flavoring to your frozen treat! The temperature difference could cause your snow cone to melt quickly, turning your snow cone to a slush cone. <|EOS|> Enjoy your flavored ice treat. <|step|> With a paper cone, it's easy enough to eat a snow cone without any utensils. For regular shaped cups or deep cups, you may want to serve your cones with a spoon. <|EOS|> Create a Kool-Aid syrup. <|step|> Add 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of water to a saucepan or small pot. Heat this on your stove on high until the mixture comes to a simmer and the sugar is dissolved. Then add your favorite Kool-Aid to the mix and stir until the Kool-Aid is completely dissolved. You should wait until your Kool-Aid syrup is completely cooled before you use it. This kind of syrup can often be kept in the refrigerator for up to a month. <|EOS|> Make a natural juice syrup. <|step|> This natural syrup can be made from your choice of fruit juice mixed with water. You should combine the two in a 2 to 1 ratio; 2 parts fruit juice to every 1 part water. For example, for every 2 cups of fruit juice, you should add 1 cup of water. You may notice that natural syrups have a slightly different taste than out-of-the-box flavors. You may need to thin the mixture with water to make it suit your tastes. <|EOS|> Mix a sugar free syrup. <|step|> You'll need a sugar free flavoring packet, like Crystal Light or Everly, but you could also use a mix of Kool-Aid and Splenda. Add these together until you achieve your desired flavor. Drizzle this on your snow cone and enjoy. <|EOS|> Make a New Orleans Style snow cone. <|step|> This special preparation of snow cone can be made with sweetened condensed milk and your choice of syrup. Sprinkle your choice of syrup over your shaved ice then add sweetened condensed milk liberally until you reach the desired level of sweetness. You may find this works easiest when using a squeeze bottle or a container with a spout. An example recipe you might try at home uses 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, 2 cans of chocolate syrup (or 2 squeeze bottles), 8 cans of evaporated milk, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Combine these ingredients in a bowl, chill the mixture, and then you can drizzle it over your crushed ice. You can adjust the amount of syrup and sweetened condensed milk to suit your tastes. Another alternative you could use in place of sweetened condensed milk is marshmallow fluff. <|EOS|> Top your snow cone with a fruit puree. <|step|> Since you've already got the blender out, it should only take you minutes to whip up a fruit puree. Add fresh or frozen fruit to your blender and hit the puree button until your fruit reaches the desired consistency. Then add the fruit to the top of your snow cones. If you have berry flavored syrups, you might consider making a berry medley puree. Add blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries to your blender, blend, and you'll have a tasty snow cone topper. If you've made a fresh fruit puree, you can freeze this to give it the same consistency as your crushed ice. Simply make your puree and allow this to freeze in your freezer overnight. Depending on how much it hardens, you may need to run it through your blender again. <|EOS|> Mix in sweets with your snow cones. <|step|> If you want a decadent dessert, you can use a spoon to stir in chocolate chips, M&M's, Sno-Caps, or whatever else you think might make a flavorful addition to your snow cones. You should stir your crushed ice and topping thoroughly to ensure an equal distribution of the sweets you've added. Be sure you take into consideration allergies. If you've added a sweet to your snow cone that is a common allergen, like the peanuts in peanut M&M's, you should inform others of this when you serve the snow cone. <|EOS|> Create adult snow cones with a dash of liqueur. <|step|> Liqueur is a sweet alcoholic spirit that can add a potent flavor to your snow cones. Some liqueurs you should consider include Frangelico (hazelnut flavor), Grand Marnier (orange flavor), and Limoncello (lemon flavor), and so on.", "Response": "I have a good recipe on how to make snow cones right here.

Be careful not to add too much flavoring to your frozen treat! The temperature difference could cause your snow cone to melt quickly, turning your snow cone to a slush cone. <|EOS|> Enjoy your flavored ice treat. <|step|> With a paper cone, it's easy enough to eat a snow cone without any utensils. For regular shaped cups or deep cups, you may want to serve your cones with a spoon. <|EOS|> Create a Kool-Aid syrup. <|step|> Add 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of water to a saucepan or small pot. Heat this on your stove on high until the mixture comes to a simmer and the sugar is dissolved. Then add your favorite Kool-Aid to the mix and stir until the Kool-Aid is completely dissolved. You should wait until your Kool-Aid syrup is completely cooled before you use it. This kind of syrup can often be kept in the refrigerator for up to a month. <|EOS|> Make a natural juice syrup. <|step|> This natural syrup can be made from your choice of fruit juice mixed with water. You should combine the two in a 2 to 1 ratio; 2 parts fruit juice to every 1 part water. For example, for every 2 cups of fruit juice, you should add 1 cup of water. You may notice that natural syrups have a slightly different taste than out-of-the-box flavors. You may need to thin the mixture with water to make it suit your tastes. <|EOS|> Mix a sugar free syrup. <|step|> You'll need a sugar free flavoring packet, like Crystal Light or Everly, but you could also use a mix of Kool-Aid and Splenda. Add these together until you achieve your desired flavor. Drizzle this on your snow cone and enjoy. <|EOS|> Make a New Orleans Style snow cone. <|step|> This special preparation of snow cone can be made with sweetened condensed milk and your choice of syrup. Sprinkle your choice of syrup over your shaved ice then add sweetened condensed milk liberally until you reach the desired level of sweetness. You may find this works easiest when using a squeeze bottle or a container with a spout. An example recipe you might try at home uses 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, 2 cans of chocolate syrup (or 2 squeeze bottles), 8 cans of evaporated milk, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Combine these ingredients in a bowl, chill the mixture, and then you can drizzle it over your crushed ice. You can adjust the amount of syrup and sweetened condensed milk to suit your tastes. Another alternative you could use in place of sweetened condensed milk is marshmallow fluff. <|EOS|> Top your snow cone with a fruit puree. <|step|> Since you've already got the blender out, it should only take you minutes to whip up a fruit puree. Add fresh or frozen fruit to your blender and hit the puree button until your fruit reaches the desired consistency. Then add the fruit to the top of your snow cones. If you have berry flavored syrups, you might consider making a berry medley puree. Add blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries to your blender, blend, and you'll have a tasty snow cone topper. If you've made a fresh fruit puree, you can freeze this to give it the same consistency as your crushed ice. Simply make your puree and allow this to freeze in your freezer overnight. Depending on how much it hardens, you may need to run it through your blender again. <|EOS|> Mix in sweets with your snow cones. <|step|> If you want a decadent dessert, you can use a spoon to stir in chocolate chips, M&M's, Sno-Caps, or whatever else you think might make a flavorful addition to your snow cones. You should stir your crushed ice and topping thoroughly to ensure an equal distribution of the sweets you've added. Be sure you take into consideration allergies. If you've added a sweet to your snow cone that is a common allergen, like the peanuts in peanut M&M's, you should inform others of this when you serve the snow cone. <|EOS|> Create adult snow cones with a dash of liqueur. <|step|> Liqueur is a sweet alcoholic spirit that can add a potent flavor to your snow cones. Some liqueurs you should consider include Frangelico (hazelnut flavor), Grand Marnier (orange flavor), and Limoncello (lemon flavor), and so on.", "Response": "The puree function is the best for snow cones.

Be sure to follow the directions that came with your blender for best results. Depending on your blender, you might have many different settings to choose from when crushing your ice. In many cases, the puree feature will give you finely crushed ice, which is ideal for snow cones. You might like your snow cones with larger bits of ice. If so, you should blend your ice for a shorter period of time. Extra fine ice can be achieved by running the ice through the blender for longer. If you don't have a blender, you can put your ice in a heavy duty plastic bag and smash the ice with a rolling pin, hammer, or tenderizing mallet. You could also drop your ice repeatedly onto a hard surface to crush this ice, though this may take some time. You can also make your snow cone out of fresh, clean snow.

You can use a large serving spoon, but you may want to use an ice cream scoop to give your snow cones a rounded shape. <|EOS|> Drizzle flavoring over your snow cone. <|step|> There are many different ways you can flavor your snow cone. You can use juice, soda, or specially made syrups. In most cases, one to two tablespoons per two scoops of ice should be enough to flavor your snow cone. Be careful not to add too much flavoring to your frozen treat! The temperature difference could cause your snow cone to melt quickly, turning your snow cone to a slush cone. <|EOS|> Enjoy your flavored ice treat. <|step|> With a paper cone, it's easy enough to eat a snow cone without any utensils. For regular shaped cups or deep cups, you may want to serve your cones with a spoon. <|EOS|> Create a Kool-Aid syrup. <|step|> Add 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of water to a saucepan or small pot. Heat this on your stove on high until the mixture comes to a simmer and the sugar is dissolved. Then add your favorite Kool-Aid to the mix and stir until the Kool-Aid is completely dissolved. You should wait until your Kool-Aid syrup is completely cooled before you use it. This kind of syrup can often be kept in the refrigerator for up to a month. <|EOS|> Make a natural juice syrup. <|step|> This natural syrup can be made from your choice of fruit juice mixed with water. You should combine the two in a 2 to 1 ratio; 2 parts fruit juice to every 1 part water. For example, for every 2 cups of fruit juice, you should add 1 cup of water. You may notice that natural syrups have a slightly different taste than out-of-the-box flavors. You may need to thin the mixture with water to make it suit your tastes. <|EOS|> Mix a sugar free syrup. <|step|> You'll need a sugar free flavoring packet, like Crystal Light or Everly, but you could also use a mix of Kool-Aid and Splenda. Add these together until you achieve your desired flavor. Drizzle this on your snow cone and enjoy. <|EOS|> Make a New Orleans Style snow cone. <|step|> This special preparation of snow cone can be made with sweetened condensed milk and your choice of syrup. Sprinkle your choice of syrup over your shaved ice then add sweetened condensed milk liberally until you reach the desired level of sweetness. You may find this works easiest when using a squeeze bottle or a container with a spout. An example recipe you might try at home uses 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, 2 cans of chocolate syrup (or 2 squeeze bottles), 8 cans of evaporated milk, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Combine these ingredients in a bowl, chill the mixture, and then you can drizzle it over your crushed ice. You can adjust the amount of syrup and sweetened condensed milk to suit your tastes. Another alternative you could use in place of sweetened condensed milk is marshmallow fluff. <|EOS|> Top your snow cone with a fruit puree. <|step|> Since you've already got the blender out, it should only take you minutes to whip up a fruit puree. Add fresh or frozen fruit to your blender and hit the puree button until your fruit reaches the desired consistency. Then add the fruit to the top of your snow cones. If you have berry flavored syrups, you might consider making a berry medley puree. Add blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries to your blender, blend, and you'll have a tasty snow cone topper. If you've made a fresh fruit puree, you can freeze this to give it the same consistency as your crushed ice. Simply make your puree and allow this to freeze in your freezer overnight. Depending on how much it hardens, you may need to run it through your blender again. <|EOS|> Mix in sweets with your snow cones. <|step|> If you want a decadent dessert, you can use a spoon to stir in chocolate chips, M&M's, Sno-Caps, or whatever else you think might make a flavorful addition to your snow cones. You should stir your crushed ice and topping thoroughly to ensure an equal distribution of the sweets you've added. Be sure you take into consideration allergies. If you've added a sweet to your snow cone that is a common allergen, like the peanuts in peanut M&M's, you should inform others of this when you serve the snow cone. <|EOS|> Create adult snow cones with a dash of liqueur. <|step|> Liqueur is a sweet alcoholic spirit that can add a potent flavor to your snow cones. Some liqueurs you should consider include Frangelico (hazelnut flavor), Grand Marnier (orange flavor), and Limoncello (lemon flavor), and so on.", "Response": "Congratulations!

Note that you should not peel the sweet potatoes during this step, even though you'll eventually remove the skins before mashing the spuds. <|EOS|> Prick the sweet potatoes. <|step|> Prick each sweet potato several times using the tines of a fork. Position these prick holes around the entire sweet potato; do not restrict them to one side. The piercing step is necessary because it regulates the distribution of heat throughout each sweet potato. If heat and steam build up in the sweet potatoes while they cook, they could burst and create a huge mess in your microwave. <|EOS|> Microwave until tender, turning once. <|step|> Microwave the sweet potatoes on full power for 5 minutes.

Continue until the mash reaches your desired consistency. For chunky sweet potatoes, add minimal milk and butter, and mash the sweet potatoes using a potato masher or fork. For smooth and creamy sweet potatoes, add the full amount of milk and butter, and use an electric hand mixer or immersion blender to create the mash. <|EOS|> Season to taste. <|step|> Choose which flavor profile you'd like to try, then add the appropriate seasonings. Mash or stir until the seasoning mix into the sweet potatoes. Keep things simple with standard salt and pepper. Use approximately 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) pepper, or adjust these amounts to taste. Try something sweet by adding a little maple syrup. Pair this flavor with cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Add paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the mash if you'd like to accent the savory side of sweet potatoes.

If you are using vanilla extract, though, do not add it now; add it alongside the butter during a later step. <|EOS|> Whisk together the cornstarch and remaining milk. <|step|> In a separate small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch with the remaining 1/2 cup (125 ml) of milk. Continue whisking until the cornstarch dissolves and the slurry seems smooth. If there are any lumps in the cornstarch slurry, those lumps will end up getting into the pudding, too. <|EOS|> Add the egg yolks. <|step|> Place the egg yolks in the cornstarch slurry and lightly beat them into the slurry using the whisk.

Adding the egg yolk slowly, thoroughly whisking as you add it, and keeping the entire mixture away from direct heat should help prevent curdling. As you whisk in the cornstarch slurry, the pudding should already start thickening. <|EOS|> Cook for an additional minute. <|step|> Return the saucepan to the stove and reduce the heat to low. Bring it to a gentle simmer and cook the pudding for another minute or two after that point. Stir frequently as the pudding continues cooking to prevent skin or lumps from forming. This step should cook the egg yolks and cornstarch, causing the pudding to thicken up further. When ready, the pudding should be thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon without running off. <|EOS|> Add the butter. <|step|> Remove the saucepan from the heat again. Add the butter to the pudding, mixing well to incorporate it. If using vanilla extract instead of an actual vanilla bean, add the vanilla extract to the pudding during this step, as well. <|EOS|> Strain the pudding. <|step|> If the pudding seems lumpy, you can push it through a strainer to catch and remove any lumps.

{"Context": "[system] Pour 2 egg yolks into the small bowl (with the milk and corn starch) and beat them using a whisk. Make sure to add only the yolks. <|EOS|> [user] There we go. Now what? <|EOS|> [system] Take the saucepan off of the heat and pour your cornstarch mix in the saucepan. Continue whisking it efficiently and well. <|EOS|> [user] Ok, I got it. Should I leave it on the heat for a little longer now, sir? <|EOS|> [system] Yes, exactly. Leave it on the heat for about 1-3 minutes and turn down the heat to low. Wait until it reaches a very light simmer and continue stirring to avoid lumps and skin forming in your pudding. <|EOS|> [user] Hmm, okay. There aren't any visible lumps or skin. What next, sir? <|EOS|> [system] Take the pan off of the heat once more and add in your 1 tbsp of butter into the mix. Once again, continue whisking. <|EOS|> [user] This sounds like a recipe for a creamy pudding. What's next? <|EOS|> [system] Now I have a question for you which will determine the next step. Does your pudding seem lumpy? <|EOS|> [user] Hmm, nope. It doesn't. Does this mean we don't need to strain it?", "File": "264-812-734_modeluser.json", "Index": 398, "Knowledge": "Combine the milk, salt, sugar, and vanilla bean. <|step|> Combine 2 cups (500 ml) of milk with the full amount of salt, sugar, and vanilla bean seeds in a medium saucepan. Place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, stirring frequently. To maximize the richness of this pudding, use whole milk. Other varieties of milk will also work, however, including low-fat dairy milk, non-fat dairy milk, almond milk, and soy milk. If you are using an actual vanilla bean for this recipe, split it open and scrape the seeds directly into the mixture during this step. If you are using vanilla extract, though, do not add it now; add it alongside the butter during a later step. <|EOS|> Whisk together the cornstarch and remaining milk. <|step|> In a separate small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch with the remaining 1/2 cup (125 ml) of milk. Continue whisking until the cornstarch dissolves and the slurry seems smooth. If there are any lumps in the cornstarch slurry, those lumps will end up getting into the pudding, too. <|EOS|> Add the egg yolks. <|step|> Place the egg yolks in the cornstarch slurry and lightly beat them into the slurry using the whisk. Use only the separated egg yolks and not the full eggs. If you choose to use liquid egg yolks instead of freshly separated yolks, measure out 2 Tbsp (30 ml) and beat them into the cornstarch slurry as usual. <|EOS|> Gradually combine the mixtures. <|step|> Remove the saucepan from the heat once the milk begins to boil. Slowly pour the cornstarch slurry into the saucepan, whisking well and continuously to combine. Since the cornstarch slurry has egg yolk in it, you need to work carefully so that the egg yolk does not over-coagulate and curdle. Adding the egg yolk slowly, thoroughly whisking as you add it, and keeping the entire mixture away from direct heat should help prevent curdling. As you whisk in the cornstarch slurry, the pudding should already start thickening. <|EOS|> Cook for an additional minute. <|step|> Return the saucepan to the stove and reduce the heat to low. Bring it to a gentle simmer and cook the pudding for another minute or two after that point. Stir frequently as the pudding continues cooking to prevent skin or lumps from forming. This step should cook the egg yolks and cornstarch, causing the pudding to thicken up further. When ready, the pudding should be thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon without running off. <|EOS|> Add the butter. <|step|> Remove the saucepan from the heat again. Add the butter to the pudding, mixing well to incorporate it. If using vanilla extract instead of an actual vanilla bean, add the vanilla extract to the pudding during this step, as well. <|EOS|> Strain the pudding. <|step|> If the pudding seems lumpy, you can push it through a strainer to catch and remove any lumps. Collect the smooth pudding in a medium to large bowl placed beneath the strainer. This step can get messy and it isn't always necessary. If you don't think there are any lumps in your pudding, or if you don't mind biting into a few, consider skipping it. <|EOS|> Cover and chill before serving. <|step|> Cover the pudding with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for about 2 hours, or until it feels cool.

Use a flat mixing spatula to distribute the chocolate in the mold if necessary. Once the mold is full, you can sprinkle in any additional ingredients you're using, such as nuts or dried fruit. Try to distribute the ingredients evenly throughout the chocolate. You can use any mold you like for this chocolate, including a bar mold, heart shapes, or any other design. If you don’t have a chocolate mold, you can use clean ice cube trays. You can also use dark chocolate to make chocolate chips, truffles, and other delicious confections. <|EOS|> Cool the chocolate. <|step|> Set the chocolate aside to cool to room temperature, because you don’t want it to harden too quickly. Once it reaches room temperature, transfer the mold to an air-tight container and into the fridge to set for about an hour. It’s important to wait before putting the chocolate in the fridge and to put it in an air-tight container first.

The string should be about 2/3 as long as the glass is deep--it should not be long enough that the weight will touch the bottom of the glass. This will give your crystals plenty of space to grow. Touching or hanging too close to the bottom or sides of the glass could make your crystals smaller or misshapen. Use a string made from natural fiber, like twine or cotton. Fishing twine or nylon string are too smooth and it will be difficult for the sugar crystals to find crevices to cling to and grow. You can also use a washer or screw to weight the string, or even another piece of rock candy, which may help your crystals grow faster. The pencil should be long enough that it can rest on the top of the glass without falling in. You can also use a butter knife, skewer, or popsicle stick instead. A butter knife or popsicle stick may be more stable, as they can lay flat on top of the glass and won't roll. <|EOS|> Dip the string in the glass of sugar/water solution, remove it, and lay on a piece of wax paper to dry. <|step|> Lay the string out straight, since it will become stiff as it dries.

You must make sure the string is completely dry before you proceed to the next step and be very careful not to knock off any of the seed crystals when you place the string in the solution. You can skip this step or try to speed it along by wetting the string and rolling it in granulated sugar (just make sure the string is completely dry before you put it in the glass and the sugar isn't falling off), but making seed crystals will make your rock candy grow faster and increase your chances of success in growing crystals. <|EOS|> Lower the string into the glass of sugar/water solution, resting the pencil on the top of the glass. <|step|> The string should hang straight down and never come in contact with the bottom or sides of the glass.

People might open and close the cabinet door and disturb the crystals. When will I know it's done? <|EOS|> [system] When you see big and smooth crystals on the string? Do you see these crystals? <|EOS|> [user] Yes. Can I eat the candy now?", "File": "163-334-290_selfchat.json", "Index": 454, "Knowledge": "Tie one end of a string around the middle of a pencil and tie a weight (such as a paperclip) to the other end. <|step|> The paperclip will act as a weight and keep your string hanging straight down so it doesn't touch the sides. The string should be about 2/3 as long as the glass is deep--it should not be long enough that the weight will touch the bottom of the glass. This will give your crystals plenty of space to grow. Touching or hanging too close to the bottom or sides of the glass could make your crystals smaller or misshapen. Use a string made from natural fiber, like twine or cotton. Fishing twine or nylon string are too smooth and it will be difficult for the sugar crystals to find crevices to cling to and grow. You can also use a washer or screw to weight the string, or even another piece of rock candy, which may help your crystals grow faster. The pencil should be long enough that it can rest on the top of the glass without falling in. You can also use a butter knife, skewer, or popsicle stick instead. A butter knife or popsicle stick may be more stable, as they can lay flat on top of the glass and won't roll. <|EOS|> Dip the string in the glass of sugar/water solution, remove it, and lay on a piece of wax paper to dry. <|step|> Lay the string out straight, since it will become stiff as it dries. As the water evaporates, you will see a few crystals form on the string. These are seed crystals and they will help larger crystals grow around these points. You must make sure the string is completely dry before you proceed to the next step and be very careful not to knock off any of the seed crystals when you place the string in the solution. You can skip this step or try to speed it along by wetting the string and rolling it in granulated sugar (just make sure the string is completely dry before you put it in the glass and the sugar isn't falling off), but making seed crystals will make your rock candy grow faster and increase your chances of success in growing crystals. <|EOS|> Lower the string into the glass of sugar/water solution, resting the pencil on the top of the glass. <|step|> The string should hang straight down and never come in contact with the bottom or sides of the glass. Cover the solution with a paper towel. You don't want to seal the glass with something that will keep the air out, like plastic wrap, as evaporation is an essential part of this process. As the water evaporates, the remaining solution becomes more saturated with sugar, and the water must force the sugar out. The sugar molecules will collect on the string, forming your rock candy crystals. Tape the pencil to the jar to keep it from rolling or moving while your crystals form. <|EOS|> Place the glass somewhere safe, where it will remain undisturbed. <|step|> For the biggest crystals, look for a cool, dark space, where the water will evaporate slowly, giving the crystals lots of time to grow. If you want to grow crystals quickly, but don't care if they get big, put the glass in a sunny spot so that the water evaporates quickly. Vibrations can negatively affect your crystal growth. Keep your glass off the ground (and away form the vibrations of people walking on the floor) and away from sources of music or noise, like a stereo or television. <|EOS|> Wait one week for crystals to form. <|step|> Don't touch or tap the glass, or you may disturb the crystal growth and even cause some to fall off the string. After a week you should see big, smooth crystals on the string. <|EOS|> Carefully remove the string from the solution and lay it on wax paper to dry. <|step|> Snip the paperclip off with scissors. If the rock candy is stuck to the glass, run some hot water on the bottom of the glass. This should loosen the sugar enough so that you can pull your candy out without damaging it.", "Response": "Yes.

Then slice each strawberry into ⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick slices and put them into a saucepan. You can use frozen strawberries for this recipe. Just thaw the strawberries in the refrigerator until they're easy enough to slice. <|EOS|> Stir in the sugar, lemon juice, and optional vanilla. <|step|> Add 1/3 cup (67 g) of granulated sugar to the saucepan along with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lemon juice. If you'd like a deeper flavor, add 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of vanilla. Stir until the berries are coated with the sugar. The lemon juice won't make the strawberry glaze taste sour. Instead, it will give the glaze a bright, fresh flavor. <|EOS|> Bring the strawberry glaze to a boil. <|step|> Turn the burner to medium so the strawberries start releasing liquid. Stir them occasionally to prevent them from burning and continue to heat the strawberries until they bubble vigorously. The strawberries will break down as they cook so there's no need to mash them. <|EOS|> Simmer the glaze for 20 to 25 minutes. <|step|> Turn the burner down to medium-low and keep the lid off of the saucepan. Stir the glaze frequently as it simmers and becomes a heavy syrup. The syrup will thicken as some of the liquid evaporates.Variation: If you prefer a very thick strawberry glaze, whisk 1 tablespoon (9 g) of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of cold water. Then stir the mixture into the hot glaze about 5 minutes before it's finished cooking and stir constantly. The amount of time it takes to cook will depend on how much moisture there was in the strawberries. <|EOS|> Turn off the burner and cool the glaze to room temperature. <|step|> Transfer the strawberry glaze to a bowl or storage container and leave it to cool until it reaches room temperature. This should take about 30 minutes. <|EOS|> Serve the strawberry glaze with breakfast or dessert. <|step|> Spoon the room-temperature glaze over pancakes. If you prefer, refrigerate the glaze until it's cold and then pour it over cheesecake or ice cream. To store the strawberry glaze, put it into an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to 3 to 4 days.

Can I turn off the heat? <|EOS|> [system] Do you want your glaze to be very thick? <|EOS|> [user] No, it looks good to me now. <|EOS|> [system] Then you can turn off the heat and let it cool. <|EOS|> [user] What's next?", "File": "225-621-533_pair.json", "Index": 529, "Knowledge": "Cut the strawberries into ⁄2 in (1.3 cm) slices and put them in a saucepan. <|step|> Rinse 1 pound (450 g) of strawberries and use a paring knife to cut off the stems. Then slice each strawberry into ⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick slices and put them into a saucepan. You can use frozen strawberries for this recipe. Just thaw the strawberries in the refrigerator until they're easy enough to slice. <|EOS|> Stir in the sugar, lemon juice, and optional vanilla. <|step|> Add 1/3 cup (67 g) of granulated sugar to the saucepan along with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lemon juice. If you'd like a deeper flavor, add 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of vanilla. Stir until the berries are coated with the sugar. The lemon juice won't make the strawberry glaze taste sour. Instead, it will give the glaze a bright, fresh flavor. <|EOS|> Bring the strawberry glaze to a boil. <|step|> Turn the burner to medium so the strawberries start releasing liquid. Stir them occasionally to prevent them from burning and continue to heat the strawberries until they bubble vigorously. The strawberries will break down as they cook so there's no need to mash them. <|EOS|> Simmer the glaze for 20 to 25 minutes. <|step|> Turn the burner down to medium-low and keep the lid off of the saucepan. Stir the glaze frequently as it simmers and becomes a heavy syrup. The syrup will thicken as some of the liquid evaporates.Variation: If you prefer a very thick strawberry glaze, whisk 1 tablespoon (9 g) of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of cold water. Then stir the mixture into the hot glaze about 5 minutes before it's finished cooking and stir constantly. The amount of time it takes to cook will depend on how much moisture there was in the strawberries. <|EOS|> Turn off the burner and cool the glaze to room temperature. <|step|> Transfer the strawberry glaze to a bowl or storage container and leave it to cool until it reaches room temperature. This should take about 30 minutes. <|EOS|> Serve the strawberry glaze with breakfast or dessert. <|step|> Spoon the room-temperature glaze over pancakes. If you prefer, refrigerate the glaze until it's cold and then pour it over cheesecake or ice cream. To store the strawberry glaze, put it into an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to 3 to 4 days. The strawberry glaze will thicken even more as it's refrigerated.", "Response": "It's finished.
