Just one more question about the mix, what do you mean by \"equal amounts of butter, caster sugar and self raising flour\"? [system] The amount of butter you should add should be equivalent to the weight of the 3 eggs that you have weighed on your scales. You should mix this butter with your caster sugar until light and fluffy. You need to use the same weight of caster sugar to that of the weight of your 3 eggs. Once this is done, add a 5ml teaspoon vanilla extract before adding your 3 eggs. Mix this with a mechanical or hand whisk until it lightens in colour. It should be a light yellow colour.

{"index": 476, "history": "[system] Hello! So today we are going to learning how to grill shrimp skewers. Have you got any wooden or metal skewers? [user] Hi! Yes I have metal ones just in my drawer. [system] Okay perfect, metal skewers work well! So let's begin by putting the shrimp onto the skewers. You can do this by thrusting the skewer through the tail and into the midsection of the shrimp. The shrimp should be in the shape of a U on the skewer. Once we've done that we can begin preheating the grill to 350-450 °F ( 177-232 °C) [user] Is there a specific amount of shrimp I should be putting on each skewer, or should I just put on as many as the skewer can fit? [system] It's totally up to your preference! You can put as many or as few as you like! [user] Sounds good! I've put about 5 on each skewer. What should I do next? [system] Great! Now we are ready to grill the shrimp. Make sure your grill has had enough time to heat up(around 10 minutes should be fine!) so as to give the shrimp an even cook. Once that's done, we can place the skewers onto the grill for 3 minutes. You should hear a sizzle when you place the shrimp on the grill. [user] Should there be a specific change of appearance that I should look out for when grilling? [system] Yes! That's a good question. The outside of the shrimp should begin turning a nice pink color as it cooks whereas the meat inside the shrimp should start turning white and opaque.", "user_utt": "[user] Okay that's good, that's how mine are looking!

Now that your shrimp have cooked you can remove them from the grill. Place them on a plate and allow them to cool for a few minutes before serving. When serving, you can serve them on the skewers or remove them. And if you have any leftovers you can put them in a sealed container and keep them in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.

To check if you have to devein the shrimp, see if there is a black vein running down the black of the shrimp. If there is, you'll need to peel and devein them. To do this, start at the top of the shrimp and cut through the shrimp's shell with a pair of scissors, making sure to not cut through the meat. You can cut all the way down to the tail or stop and leave the tail. Leaving the tail will allow you to more easily handle the shrimp for dipping if you want to eat your shrimp with a sauce. Once you've peeled the excess shell throw it away. Now that we've peeled the shrimp, we need to devein. You can do this by using a small sharp knife and cutting down the back of the shrimp and removing the back vein. After deveining the shrimp, rinse under cold water. And if you've already bought deveined shrimp you can ignore all of this and begin seasoning! How's your shrimp looking?
