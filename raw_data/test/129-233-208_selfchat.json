Heat the milks until the mixture comes to a light simmer. Don't let it come to a full boil. Remove the pan from heat. A note on coconut milk: choose full-fat coconut milk, rather than low-fat, for best flavor. Don't confuse coconut milk with cream of coconut, which is a different product. It's normal for coconut milk to separate during storage; just scoop it into the saucepan and mix it up.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/56/Make-Coconut-Ice-Cream-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Make-Coconut-Ice-Cream-Step-1-Version-2.jpg"}, {"summary": "Mix the eggs, sugar and salt.", "description": "In a separate bowl, mix the eggs, sugar and salt with a whisk.

In most cases you will be instructed to transfer the churned ice cream to the freezer for a few hours until it firms up and become scoopable. If you don't have an ice cream maker, freeze it as follows: pour the chilled custard into a shallow baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze it for 45 minutes, then unwrap it and stir the custard to whip some air into the mixture. Wrap it back up, put it in the freezer and repeat every 45 minutes until the mixture is frozen and scoopable. The more frequently you stir, the lighter and fluffier your ice cream will be.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6a/Make-Coconut-Ice-Cream-Step-6.jpg/v4-460px-Make-Coconut-Ice-Cream-Step-6.jpg"}]}}
