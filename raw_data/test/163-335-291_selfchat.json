Firstly, wet your skewer with water and roll it in the sugar", "evidence": ["Wet a skewer or popsicle stick with water and roll it in granulated sugar."], "id": "Agent", "dialog_act": "teach new step"}, {"text": "Can I use any kind of sugar?", "chosenReferece": "", "id": "User", "dialog_act": "ask question"}, {"text": "You need to use granualted sugar.

What's next?", "chosenReferece": "", "id": "User", "dialog_act": "ask to move on"}, {"text": "Have you allowed your skewers to dry?
