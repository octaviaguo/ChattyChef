Allow the beans to soak in the water at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours. With most dried beans, it is recommended that you soak the beans before cooking them. Doing so softens the beans and also removes most of the water-soluble components responsible for digestive upset. Note that with adzuki beans, however, you can often skip the soaking process without suffering adverse reactions. Soaking will make the beans slightly easier to digest, but it is not absolutely essential. You can soak the beans anywhere from 1 hour to overnight.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0e/Cook-Adzuki-Beans-Step-1.jpg/v4-459px-Cook-Adzuki-Beans-Step-1.jpg"}, {"summary": "Replace the water.", "description": "Drain the water by pouring the contents of the pot through a colander.
