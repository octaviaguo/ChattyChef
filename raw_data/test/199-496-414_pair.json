Find a mug that's microwavable prior to mixing your ingredients. The mug should say whether it's microwavable somewhere on the label.

Butter that's at room temperature has already been softened. This recipe calls for slightly softened butter. Place your butter in the mug. Microwave it for 10 to 15 minutes. You do not want melted butter for this recipe. You want butter that is slightly softened. Start off microwaving your butter for 10 seconds and then check it. You should also keep an eye on the butter while it's microwaving. Make sure that your butter does not begin to melt.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c9/Make-a-Single-Serving-Cake-Step-6.jpg/v4-460px-Make-a-Single-Serving-Cake-Step-6.jpg"}, {"summary": "Add the sugar and egg.", "description": "Stir in the sugar and egg until you have a light, fluffy mixture that's even throughout.

Bake your cake for 1 minute and then check on it. If it needs to cook longer, cook it for 10 more seconds. Keep checking on the cake every 10 seconds until it's cooked. Your cake will be ready when you can stick a fork in it and have it come out clean. The cake will be very hot when you remove it from the microwave, so make sure to let it cool for a few minutes before eating it.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1a/Make-a-Single-Serving-Cake-Step-10.jpg/v4-460px-Make-a-Single-Serving-Cake-Step-10.jpg"}]}}
