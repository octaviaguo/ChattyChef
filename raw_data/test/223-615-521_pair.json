Lay the sausage on a cutting board and cut it into slices roughly half an inch thick using a sharp knife. The thicker slices will need to cook longer, but there will be less chance that the sausage filling will crumble as it heats. You can also begin slicing the sausage while it\u2019s still in the plastic wrapper and remove the plastic and the skin together. Blood sausages like black pudding have a more delicate consistency because they contain very little actual meat. The oats and grains inside will not hold up as well to cooking as meatier sausages.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b9/Cook-Black-Pudding-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Cook-Black-Pudding-Step-1-Version-2.jpg"}, {"summary": "Remove the skin.", "description": "Make a small incision at the edge of each slice with your knife and then peel away the skin.

Place the slices flat in the pan and let them start cooking. Black pudding will cook just fine in its own fat, much like bacon or other varieties of sausage. Butter and oil can be used for flavor and to give the outer layer an extra crispy finish. For a traditional English breakfast, add other ingredients to the pan that can be fried at the same time\u2014eggs, bacon, potatoes, and other sausages are all fair game.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0e/Cook-Black-Pudding-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/v4-459px-Cook-Black-Pudding-Step-3-Version-2.jpg"}, {"summary": "Fry for 3-4 minutes on each side.", "description": "Fry the black pudding slices for 3-4 minutes before turning them.
