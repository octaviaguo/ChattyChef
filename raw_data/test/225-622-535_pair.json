A simple rinse after peeling the spuds should be enough to remove any residual dirt from the flesh. Try to keep the pieces evenly sized to promote consistent cooking. If you cut the pieces much smaller than instructed, they may disintegrate. If you cut them too large, they will take longer to cook.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c4/Make-Sweet-Potato-Mash-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Make-Sweet-Potato-Mash-Step-1-Version-2.jpg"}, {"summary": "Cover with water.", "description": "Place the cubed sweet potatoes in a large stockpot.
