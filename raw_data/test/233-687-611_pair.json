Since quail eggs are so small, they can be difficult to crack without breaking the yolk.

Alternatively, you can carefully peel off the end of the shell with your fingers and pinch the inner membrane to break the egg open. Pour out the contents from that hole. If you decide to cook more eggs than called for in this recipe, work in small batches, preparing about four eggs in each one.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8c/Cook-Quail-Eggs-Step-7.jpg/v4-460px-Cook-Quail-Eggs-Step-7.jpg"}, {"summary": "Slide the eggs into the oil.", "description": "Pour each quail egg out of its ramekin, allowing it to gently slide into the hot oil in the pan.
