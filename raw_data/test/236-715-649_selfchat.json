We've provided a few sample recipes above. For stir fry beginners, it doesn't get much easier than the \"Basic\" sauce at the top of the list. Not only is it easy to make, but also mild and pleasing to the taste. To begin, pour all of your ingredients except cornstarch into a bowl that's big enough to accommodate them.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d6/Make-Stir-Fry-Sauce-Step-1-Version-3.jpg/v4-460px-Make-Stir-Fry-Sauce-Step-1-Version-3.jpg"}, {"summary": "Mix your ingredients (minus corn starch) thoroughly.", "description": "Using a spoon, an electric mixer, or another mixing utensil, give your liquid sauce ingredients and sugar a quick stirring until they make a mixture that's uniform in color and texture. If you're using the \"Basic\" recipe above, make sure the sugar in the recipe is dissolved before proceeding or it may give the dish uneven \"sweet spots\" when it's added. If you're having a hard time getting the sugar to dissolve, try heating the sauce up somewhat \u2014 as a rule of basic chemistry, liquids dissolve substances like sugar more easily when they're warm. However, you won't want to heat the sauce to the point that it's very hot or boiling \u2014 this can caramelize the sugar, giving the sauce a \"sticky\" texture and an odd taste.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c1/Make-Stir-Fry-Sauce-Step-2-Version-3.jpg/v4-460px-Make-Stir-Fry-Sauce-Step-2-Version-3.jpg"}, {"summary": "Add corn starch to thicken as necessary.", "description": "Finally, add your corn starch and stir to combine. You have some freedom with this step \u2014 corn starch is a thickening agent, so the more you add, the thicker your sauce will become. The ideal thickness of your sauce is usually a matter of personal taste. The 1/2 teaspoon recommended in the recipe above should give a fairly liquid sauce, but anything from zero corn starch to twice the recommended portion is acceptable. Note that this thickening rule applies to the rest of the recipes in this article as well. Though it may not be explicitly mentioned below, adding additional corn starch to any of the following recipes will make a thicker sauce, while removing corn starch from the recipe will make a thinner sauce.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/cf/Make-Stir-Fry-Sauce-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/v4-460px-Make-Stir-Fry-Sauce-Step-3-Version-3.jpg"}, {"summary": "Alternatively, mix in a jar.", "description": "If you don't have any stirring utensils handy or you want to prep your sauce for storage in the fridge, consider mixing it in a jar.

Within about 30 seconds to a minute, remove the pan from heat and serve! Another good option is to use your sauce for dipping. In this case, keep it cool and separate from the other ingredients in its own bowl.
