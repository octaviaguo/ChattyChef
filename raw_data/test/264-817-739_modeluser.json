The circle needs to be slightly larger than your saucer.Did You Know? Although you can use fondant instead of gum paste, the gum paste is stabilized with egg whites, shortening, and powdered sugar which will make it easier to roll thin. Gum paste will also show detail better than fondant. If you don't have a fondant rolling pin, use a standard rolling pin and dust it with powdered sugar to prevent the gum paste from sticking to it.", "Dust a little powdered sugar onto the saucer and then tap it out. Gently lay the rolled gum paste onto the saucer and press down firmly so the paste molds to the saucer. Then use a knife or blade tool to cut the excess gum paste from around the edge of the saucer. Set the excess aside and smooth the edges of the gum paste saucer. If you want to include details on the edges of your saucer, press in the edges to create a slight scallop.", "Take some of the remaining gum paste and roll it into a 3 in (7.6 cm) log that's as thin as you like. Bend the log into a question mark shape that will form the handle for your teacup. Set the handle aside along with the saucer to set while you work on the teacup's base. Your handle can be as simplistic or intricate as you like.", "Cut another small rope that you can wrap into a circle. Squirt a few drops of edible glue onto 1 end of the rope and attach the other end so you have a ring. Then roll out more gum paste as thinly as you made the saucer and cut it into a circle that's the same size as the base of the teacup. Squeeze edible glue onto it and stick it onto the ring you made. Set this circular base aside while you make the teacup. Purchase edible glue from craft supply stores or online.", "Use the fondant rolling pin to roll the leftover gum paste into an oval that's as thin as the saucer you made. Then cut a large rainbow out and place it inside the teacup so the wider side faces the lip of the cup. You may need to trim or make adjustments to the shape of the gum paste so it covers the inside of the teacup. Keep in mind that there will be a small hole at the bottom of the cup. To ensure the rainbow is the right size before cutting the gum paste, cut out a paper template and nestle it into the teacup first.", "Use your fingers to push the gum paste evenly into the teacup so there aren't any gaps. Push the gum paste down to cover the hole at the bottom of the cup. Pay attention to joining the edges where the ends of the gum paste meet. Then set the teacup aside to set up overnight. If there's not enough gum paste to close the bottom of the teacup, cut a small circle of gum paste and push it into place.", "Once the teacup is hard, gently pull it out of the actual teacup. Then squirt a little edible glue onto the circular base you made and set the gum paste teacup on it. Take the handle and squeeze a little edible glue on it before you press it against the side of the teacup. Leave the teacup for a few hours so the glue hardens.Tip: For an extra-strong hold, melt about 1 ounce (30 g) of white chocolate and paint it around the teacup's handle and base.
