If you love a lot of sauce, go ahead and slather it on. If you prefer your pizza on the dry side, spoon a little in the middle and spread it around in a thin layer. If you want to make a white pizza, add a little extra olive oil and skip the pizza sauce. You can make a quick pizza sauce using tomato paste, a can of diced tomatoes, and some spices. Simmer the paste and tomatoes (without draining them first) together over low heat. Add salt, oregano and pepper to taste. Continue simmering until the sauce cooks down to the consistency of pizza sauce.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/97/Make-Pizza-Step-3-Version-8.jpg/550px-nowatermark-Make-Pizza-Step-3-Version-8.jpg"}, {"summary": "Add toppings.", "description": "Layer your favorite toppings over the sauce.

Continue until your pizza is loaded with the amount of toppings you like. Other than pepperoni and ham which are pre-cooked, meat toppings should always be cooked before you put them on the pizza. They'll get heated when you bake the pizza, but they won't fully cook. If you're using ground beef, sausage, chicken, or another meat, cook it thoroughly in a pan on the stove or in the oven and drain the grease before you add it to your pizza. Remember that if you add too many vegetable toppings, your pizza crust may turn out a little soggy. The water from the vegetables moistens the dough.
