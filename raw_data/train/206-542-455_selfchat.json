May I ask what dish you are planning to make with these scallions?", "evidence": [], "id": "Agent", "dialog_act": "other"}, {"text": "Hello, yes exactly. I'm not one hundred percent sure yet but I like scallions and thought I should learn this.", "chosenReferece": "", "id": "User", "dialog_act": "answer question"}, {"text": "Okay great, not a problem. So to start off you will want a jar, preferably a mason jar that you can fill with about 2 inches of water. Depending on how many scallions you have you may need a couple of jars.", "evidence": ["Fill a jar with 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water"], "id": "Agent", "dialog_act": "teach new step"}, {"text": "Perfect, i'm way ahead of you there. I made sure to grab a few this morning on my way home from work. What's next?", "chosenReferece": "", "id": "User", "dialog_act": "ask to move on"}, {"text": "Glad to hear you came prepared. So once you have your jar(s) filled with the right amount of water, you should grab your scallions and ensure you place them inside with the roots submerged in the water.", "evidence": ["Place the scallions standing up in the jar of water"], "id": "Agent", "dialog_act": "teach new step"}, {"text": "Understood, thank you. Does it matter how much of the scallions are covered by water? and by root you mean the white part I assume? Just checking.", "chosenReferece": "", "id": "User", "dialog_act": "ask question"}, {"text": "Good questions. Yes the roots are the white part and if the whole roots don't seem to be submerged you should add water as needed until you can confidently say they are.", "evidence": [" (the white ends of the stalks) should be down in the water", "If the water in the jar doesn't come up all the way to the top of the roots, add more water"], "id": "Agent", "dialog_act": "answer question"}, {"text": "cool, I thought so just wanted to make sure.
