First off, we want to make sure we buy the right type of shrimp so that everything will go smoothly. It is best to buy large shrimp, this way the shrimp won't fall through the grill and won't overcook as easy as small shrimp. For this recipe, it's best to buy either U/10 or U/20 shrimp which means 10 or 20 shrimp per pound. We can either use fresh or frozen shrimp; which will you be using today?", "evidence": ["Buy large frozen or fresh shrimp", "Jumbo and larger variations of shrimp are the best for grilling because they won\u2019t fall through the grates of the grill and are easier to handle than smaller shrimp", "Smaller shrimp are also more likely to overcook on the grill, which could lead to a rubbery or tough texture.", "Buy U/10 or U/20 shrimp. This means that there is either 10 or 20 shrimp per pound", "Cook fresh shrimp the same day that you purchase them or freeze them If you plan on making them later", "keep them on a bed of ice so that they don\u2019t go bad."], "id": "Agent", "dialog_act": "teach new step"}, {"text": "I have some frozen shrimp already in the freezer, so I'll use that.", "chosenReferece": "", "id": "User", "dialog_act": "answer question"}, {"text": "Okay, sounds good! So with frozen shrimp we will want to thaw them. You can either thaw them in the refrigerator overnight or if you want to save time, rinse them under cold water for an hour. Once they've thawed, you'll want to rinse them one last time with cold water and then drain them in a colander. Afterwards, pat them dry with paper towels. Shrimp, when properly thawed, should look slightly translucent.

Now we'll need to devein your shrimp if you haven't boughten already deveined shrimp. To check if you have to devein the shrimp, see if there is a black vein running down the black of the shrimp. If there is, you'll need to peel and devein them. To do this, start at the top of the shrimp and cut through the shrimp's shell with a pair of scissors, making sure to not cut through the meat. You can cut all the way down to the tail or stop and leave the tail. Leaving the tail will allow you to more easily handle the shrimp for dipping if you want to eat your shrimp with a sauce. Once you've peeled the excess shell throw it away. Now that we've peeled the shrimp, we need to devein. You can do this by using a small sharp knife and cutting down the back of the shrimp and removing the back vein. After deveining the shrimp, rinse under cold water.
