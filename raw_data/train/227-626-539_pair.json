Yes I have metal ones just in my drawer.", "chosenReferece": "", "id": "User", "dialog_act": "answer question"}, {"text": "Okay perfect, metal skewers work well! So let's begin by putting the shrimp onto the skewers. You can do this by thrusting the skewer through the tail and into the midsection of the shrimp. The shrimp should be in the shape of a U on the skewer.

Make sure your grill has had enough time to heat up(around 10 minutes should be fine!) so as to give the shrimp an even cook. Once that's done, we can place the skewers onto the grill for 3 minutes.

Now that your shrimp have cooked you can remove them from the grill. Place them on a plate and allow them to cool for a few minutes before serving.

If you are using a charcoal grill, load the charcoal into the bottom of the grill and stack the charcoal in a pyramid shape.

Some charcoal grills have an electric starter. If this is the case, hit the button or switch to ignite the coals after you\u2019ve loaded it.
