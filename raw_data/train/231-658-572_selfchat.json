This means taking it out of the refrigerator, placing it in a pan (to catch any drippings), and letting it sit at room temperature. If you are cooking a small roast, you should let it sit for roughly 30 to 60 minutes, while large roasts can sit for up to an hour and a half. Resting the roast allows the meat to become moist again--when it is in the refrigerator, the meat tends to become tougher.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a0/Cook-a-Roast-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Cook-a-Roast-Step-1-Version-2.jpg"}, {"summary": "Estimate the time it will take your roast to cook.", "description": "Generally, roasting time can be estimated by how many pounds of meat you will be cooking. The length of time you cook your roast for will depend on whether you want your meat rare, medium rare, or medium. However, please note that every oven is different so while this offers an estimate of the cooking time, you should still monitor the internal temperature of the meat to determine when it is done. For a rare roast: Allow 15 minutes of cooking time for every pound of roast. For example, if you had a 5 pound roast, you would cook your roast for 75 minutes if you wanted it rare. For a medium rare roast: Cook the roast for 20 minutes for every pound. If you were cooking a 5 pound roast, you would cook it for 100 minutes. For a medium roast: Allow 22 minutes of cooking time for every pound. If you were cooking a 5 pound roast, you would cook the meat for 110 minutes. If you are cooking a pork roast, you should allow 20 minutes per pound of meat.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/ff/Cook-a-Roast-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Cook-a-Roast-Step-2-Version-2.jpg"}, {"summary": "Preheat your oven to the right temperature.", "description": "This will be determined by the kind of meat you will be roasting.
