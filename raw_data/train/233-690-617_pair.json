You should mix this butter with your caster sugar until light and fluffy. You need to use the same weight of caster sugar to that of the weight of your 3 eggs. Once this is done, add a 5ml teaspoon vanilla extract before adding your 3 eggs. Mix this with a mechanical or hand whisk until it lightens in colour. It should be a light yellow colour. Once this is done, weigh out the same amount of your self raising flour to that of the weight of your eggs and gently fold it in with a spatula.

If you do not dissolve the Jello mix entirely, it will clump and not congeal properly. If you decide to make a layered Jello cake, use 1 box of gelatin for each layer. You could coordinate for holidays such as red and blue gelatin for the 4th of July. This is also a good idea, if you are trying to accommodate a lot of people who prefer different flavors. For a vegan option, use Weikfield jelly based on agar-agar (a seaweed). It is available in India and in Indian stores worldwide. It works just like Jello for this recipe. Jello is not a vegan dessert.
