If you want to season your oysters beforehand, shucking them is your best bet. If you'd prefer to season them after cooking, or perhaps not at all, you're better off leaving them in their shells while they cook. How do you shuck oysters? Wrap the top of the oyster in a towel or put on heavy-duty gloves for protection. Slide an oyster knife into the hinge (backside) of the oyster. Twist the oyster knife by turning your wrist, like you're turning on the ignition in your car with a key. Scrape the blade across the top part of the oyster shell, twisting to open the muscle. Remove the top portion of the shell and loosen the oyster foot from the bottom shell with your knife.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/32/Cook-Oysters-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/v4-459px-Cook-Oysters-Step-7-Version-2.jpg"}, {"summary": "Prepare a seasoning for oysters on the half shell (optional).", "description": "Oysters are great raw or cooked in their own brine, but sometimes a little seasoning makes the oyster shine even more.
