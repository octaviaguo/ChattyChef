In many cases, the puree feature will give you finely crushed ice, which is ideal for snow cones. You might like your snow cones with larger bits of ice. If so, you should blend your ice for a shorter period of time. Extra fine ice can be achieved by running the ice through the blender for longer. If you don't have a blender, you can put your ice in a heavy duty plastic bag and smash the ice with a rolling pin, hammer, or tenderizing mallet. You could also drop your ice repeatedly onto a hard surface to crush this ice, though this may take some time. You can also make your snow cone out of fresh, clean snow. You should exercise caution when doing this, though.
