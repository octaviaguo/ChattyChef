The string should be about 2/3 as long as the glass is deep--it should not be long enough that the weight will touch the bottom of the glass. This will give your crystals plenty of space to grow. Touching or hanging too close to the bottom or sides of the glass could make your crystals smaller or misshapen. Use a string made from natural fiber, like twine or cotton. Fishing twine or nylon string are too smooth and it will be difficult for the sugar crystals to find crevices to cling to and grow. You can also use a washer or screw to weight the string, or even another piece of rock candy, which may help your crystals grow faster. The pencil should be long enough that it can rest on the top of the glass without falling in. You can also use a butter knife, skewer, or popsicle stick instead.

You can skip this step or try to speed it along by wetting the string and rolling it in granulated sugar (just make sure the string is completely dry before you put it in the glass and the sugar isn't falling off), but making seed crystals will make your rock candy grow faster and increase your chances of success in growing crystals.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e1/Make-Rock-Candy-Step-7-Version-4.jpg/550px-nowatermark-Make-Rock-Candy-Step-7-Version-4.jpg"}, {"summary": "Lower the string into the glass of sugar/water solution, resting the pencil on the top of the glass.", "description": "The string should hang straight down and never come in contact with the bottom or sides of the glass.
