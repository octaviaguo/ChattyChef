A ripe watermelon will give off a lower-pitched and more hollow sound, whereas an unripe one will have a higher pitch to it. This can take some practice but is one of the more reliable ways to check for ripeness. If you're unsure if your melon is making the right sound, find someone who can demonstrate it for you on a melon they know to be right. Ask around or check online to find out what the perfect melon should sound like. Use your phone or another device to record the sound of a melon you think is ripe. If it's perfect when you cut into it, you can keep that recording to test the sound of other melons from the same and future crops.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0c/Tell-when-a-Watermelon-Is-Ripe-and-Ready-for-Picking-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Tell-when-a-Watermelon-Is-Ripe-and-Ready-for-Picking-Step-4-Version-2.jpg"}, {"summary": "Squeeze the watermelon to test its give.", "description": "A ripe watermelon should have a little give to it when firmly squeezed.

Get close up to the watermelon and inhale deeply. A ripe melon should have a sweet scent to it, and remind you of the flavor of a perfectly ripe watermelon. If you're growing a lot of watermelons, this test might become less effective. It's much more difficult to pick out the smell of 1 watermelon from a field of them than it would be testing one on its own. While it works on watermelons, the smell test is even more effective with other types of melon.", "img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/05/Tell-when-a-Watermelon-Is-Ripe-and-Ready-for-Picking-Step-7.jpg/v4-460px-Tell-when-a-Watermelon-Is-Ripe-and-Ready-for-Picking-Step-7.jpg"}]}}
