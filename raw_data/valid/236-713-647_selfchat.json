Let's begin on the first step: Grab your chopped chocolate or chips and place them in a large ceramic or heatproof/resistant bowl. Place that bowl to the side. Then turn the heat on your stove and place the cream in a small saucepan and heat it on the stove until it reaches a boil. Once the cream is boiling, pour it into your bowl with the chocolate that you placed to the side. Now stir until the cream and chocolate are completely combined.", "evidence": ["Make the chocolate mixture."], "id": "Agent", "dialog_act": "teach new step"}, {"text": "Done.

It is now a chocolatey mixture, totally combined. What do I do next?", "chosenReferece": "", "id": "User", "dialog_act": "ask to move on"}, {"text": "Great to hear! For the next step you will need to grab 1 tablespoon of liqueur and mix it into the bowl of melted chocolate and cream. You can select any flavour you prefer of liqueur. Which flavour did you use?", "evidence": ["Add flavoring"], "id": "Agent", "dialog_act": "teach new step"}, {"text": "I am using an almond liqueur. But I usually prefer the flavour to be a bit stronger than 1 tablespoon. Could I add a bit extra, like a teaspoon more?", "chosenReferece": "", "id": "User", "dialog_act": "ask question"}, {"text": "That is a great choice. If you prefer to have a stronger almond flavour in your baking, you can add a bit more, but I wouldn't go overboard as it may impact the overall end result.

What do I do next?", "chosenReferece": "", "id": "User", "dialog_act": "ask to move on"}, {"text": "That is exactly how the mixture should be. Next we will cool the mixture to ensure that the overall product comes out perfectly - or as close to perfect as we can get. Pour the warm mixture into either a baking pan or cake pan.

Do I leave the mixture to thicken more?", "chosenReferece": "", "id": "User", "dialog_act": "ask to move on"}, {"text": "Great! Now that it has started to thicken, you should stir it once more before taking some plastic wrap, and covering the baking pan and placing it in the refrigerator.

The next step is to take the pan out of the refrigerator and place it on your kitchen counter or nearby table. You will also need to grab a baking sheet and line it with parchment paper or wax paper (whichever you have available). Then grab a small ice cream scoop or teaspoon. You will use this item to start scooping chocolate from the pan.

Alternatively you can run your hands under cold water, dry them off and then continue to shape the balls.

Next you want to grab cocoa powder or any other topping you want to use to coat the balls. This can be chopped nuts, sprinkles, or anything you prefer.

Are the truffles completed coated in the topping?", "evidence": ["Coat the truffles."], "id": "Agent", "dialog_act": "teach new step"}, {"text": "I decided to use sprinkles.
